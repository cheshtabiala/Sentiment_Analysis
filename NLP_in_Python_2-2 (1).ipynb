              "'\\nCrossroads of Empire: John Gray’s Vision of Political Realignment and the Fate of the West\\nJohn Gray, the prolific political philosopher, has long been a figure of intrigue and controversy. Over the past half-century, Gray has navigated the intellectual currents of political thought, never comfortably fitting into a single ideological box. His ability to provoke thought across the political spectrum is perhaps best encapsulated in his latest work, which examines the changing fortunes of the West through a prism of revived historical paradigms: feudalism, religious orthodoxy, and ultra-nationalism.\\nGray’s central thesis challenges the modern consensus on growth and progress, suggesting that neither are guaranteed nor inevitable. This perspective underpins his broader critique of globalization and liberal capitalism, positions that have brought him both acclaim and criticism. His skepticism towards the West’s commitment to these ideologies has proven prescient, with his early critiques of globalization and the pitfalls of military occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq now widely acknowledged as accurate.\\nIn his recent book, The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism, Gray turns his attention to what he perceives as the declining trajectory of Western dominance, proposing that the future may see a return to older forms of social organization and governance. This outlook is deeply intertwined with his critique of contemporary liberal policies, which he argues have inadvertently fueled the rise of populism. Gray sees populism not as an aberration but as a direct backlash against the social disruptions caused by liberal economic and cultural policies.\\nCentral to Gray’s analysis is the idea that Western liberalism, with its emphasis on individual autonomy and economic deregulation, has reached a critical juncture. He suggests that the crises facing the West today are symptomatic of deeper ideological failures. These include a misplaced faith in the universality of liberal democracy and capitalism, which, in his view, have led to increasing social fragmentation and economic inequality. Gray argues that the responses to these crises, from both the political left and right, have been largely inadequate, mired in outdated modes of thinking that fail to address the root causes of contemporary malaise.\\nMoreover, Gray posits that the current moment represents a crossroads for the West, one that requires a fundamental reevaluation of its values and political systems. He envisions a future in which the West might see a resurgence of forms of social organization that have historically been associated with pre-modern societies. This includes a revival of feudalistic structures, a return to more orthodox religious practices, and a strengthening of ultra-nationalist sentiments. According to Gray, these developments are not necessarily regressive but reflect a complex interplay of historical, cultural, and economic forces that challenge the linear conception of history as a progression towards liberal democracy and capitalism.\\nGray’s critique extends beyond mere political analysis, delving into the philosophical underpinnings of Western thought. He challenges the Enlightenment belief in reason and progress, suggesting that such ideals have led to an overconfidence in the ability of liberal democracy and capitalism to address the fundamental challenges of human existence. Instead, Gray calls for a more nuanced understanding of human nature and history, one that recognizes the limitations of rationalism and the inevitability of cyclical patterns of social and political organization.\\nIn conclusion, John Gray’s work represents a provocative challenge to the conventional wisdom regarding the West’s past, present, and future. By drawing on a wide array of historical, philosophical, and political insights, Gray offers a compelling critique of the assumptions that have shaped Western thought for centuries. His analysis suggests that the West may be on the cusp of a profound transformation, one that could see the resurgence of older forms of social organization and governance. Whether one agrees with Gray’s conclusions or not, his work undeniably provides a rich source of reflection on the complexities of contemporary political life and the unpredictable nature of historical change.\\n\\n* * *\\nAaron Bastani’s interview with John Gray covers a broad range of topics, delving into his critiques of globalization, liberalism, and the current political and economic trajectory of the West. Here are the key points discussed:\\n• Critique of Globalization and Liberalism: Gray criticized the optimistic belief in inevitable globalization and liberal democracy, arguing that these trends are neither inevitable nor universally beneficial. His skepticism towards globalization, which he expressed in his earlier work, was met with widespread criticism at the time but has since been vindicated by events.\\n• Skepticism Towards Progress: He challenges the notion of inevitable progress and growth, suggesting that history is cyclical rather than linear, and that we may be returning to older forms of living and governance, such as feudalism, ultra-nationalism, and religious orthodoxy.\\n• Critique of Western Policies and Populism: Gray links the rise of populism to the social disruptions caused by policies from liberal elites, arguing they fail to see the connection between their actions and the political blowback they receive.\\nViews on the Future of the West: He predicts a shift away from the ideologies and structures that have dominated recent decades, suggesting a return to more traditional, possibly pre-modern, forms of social organization.\\n• The Role of Religion and Nationalism: Contrary to the expectations of liberal universalism, Gray highlights the resurgence of nationalism and religion as central forces in global politics, underscoring their role in the collapse of communism and the ongoing resistance to liberal hegemony.\\n• Economic Critiques: Gray criticizes the current economic system, predicting further fragmentation and the potential for a return to more localized, less globalized economic models. He sees the current trend towards deglobalization as an acknowledgment of the failures of the globalizing project.\\n• Criticism of the European Union (EU): He views the EU as a flawed project, arguing that it is designed to prevent the emergence of socialism or moderate social democracy, favoring a neoliberal economic model instead.\\n• Hyper-Liberal Ideology and its Consequences: Gray critiques the rise of what he calls “hyper-liberal ideology,” seeing it as an extension of Western liberalism that paradoxically seeks to undermine Western values. He associates it with the elite’s attempt to secure power amidst capitalism’s failures.\\n• Predictions for American Politics: Gray foresees a legitimation crisis in the United States, with increasing political polarization and a potential inward turn, reducing its global influence and commitments.\\n• Views on Political and Ethical Choices: He discusses the inevitability of tragic choices in politics, where any action or inaction involves irreparable losses or wrongs, challenging the notion that perfect solutions exist for societal problems.\\nGray’s perspective offers a critical and often contrarian view of contemporary political and economic trends, questioning the assumptions underlying liberal democracy, globalization, and the notion of inevitable progress.\\n* * *\\nThe nonsense of centrism\\nJohn Gray’s critique of centrism is multifaceted and reflects his broader skepticism towards dominant political ideologies and narratives. When he refers to the “nonsense of centrism,” he is critiquing a political stance that positions itself as a moderate or middle ground between the perceived extremes of left and right politics. Here are the key aspects of Gray’s critique:\\n• Centrism as a Hollow Ideology: Gray views centrism not as a coherent ideology with substantive policies but as a political stance that often lacks depth and fails to address the underlying issues facing society. Centrists claim to offer pragmatic solutions, yet their policies may be disconnected from the realities of widespread inequality, social fragmentation, and the dissatisfaction of large segments of the population.\\n• Failure to Address Structural Problems: Centrism, in Gray’s view, often represents an attempt to maintain the status quo by making minor adjustments rather than tackling the root causes of economic and social issues. This approach can be seen as inadequate in times of significant upheaval or when faced with systemic challenges, such as those brought about by globalization, technological change, and environmental crises.\\n• The Illusion of a Non-ideological Stance: Centrists often claim to be above the fray of ideological battles, positioning themselves as rational and evidence-based arbiters. However, Gray would argue that this is an illusion and that centrism itself is ideologically driven, promoting a particular vision of society that upholds existing power structures and economic models.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Disconnection from Popular Sentiments: Gray suggests that centrism is often out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of ordinary people. By focusing on a narrow band of policies deemed acceptable by political and economic elites, centrists can alienate large portions of the electorate who feel their voices and concerns are not being heard.\\n• Convergence of Political Parties: One consequence of centrism, according to Gray, is the convergence of major political parties around a set of neoliberal policies, reducing the diversity of political options available to voters. This convergence can lead to voter apathy and disillusionment with the political process, as significant differences between parties become harder to discern.\\n• Populism as a Reaction to Centrism: Gray links the rise of populism, in part, to the failures of centrism. Populist movements can be seen as a backlash against the perceived elitism and ineffectiveness of centrist policies, tapping into feelings of neglect and disenfranchisement among the public.\\nJohn Gray’s critique of centrism is that it fails to adequately address the complex challenges facing modern societies, often serves to preserve the status quo at the expense of meaningful change, and can contribute to political polarization and the rise of populist movements by neglecting the concerns of large segments of the population.\\n* * *\\nHow the UK is facing Collapse, according to John Gray?\\nJohn Gray’s insights on the potential for the UK’s collapse are interwoven with his broader critiques of globalization, liberal ideology, and the political and economic trajectories of Western societies. While he doesn’t predict a literal collapse in the sense of a sudden disintegration, his analysis suggests a series of challenges and transformations that could fundamentally alter the UK’s future stability and prosperity. Key themes from Gray’s perspective include:\\n• Economic Fragility and Inequality: Gray highlights the UK’s vulnerability due to its highly financialized economy and dependence on global financial markets. He suggests that the economic model adopted by the UK, heavily reliant on finance and service industries, is susceptible to global economic shocks and crises, leading to increased inequality and social fragmentation.\\n• Political Disintegration and Legitimation Crisis: He argues that the UK is experiencing a crisis of legitimacy, where increasing segments of the population no longer feel represented by the political establishment. This is exacerbated by the polarization over issues like Brexit and the rise of nationalist sentiments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, threatening the unity of the United Kingdom.\\n• Impact of Brexit: Gray discusses Brexit as a symptom of deeper societal divides and an example of the elite’s failure to anticipate or understand the consequences of their policies. The process of leaving the EU has exposed and intensified existing political and economic vulnerabilities, including challenges to the UK’s global standing and economic stability.\\n• Social and Cultural Divisions: The rise of what Gray terms “hyper-liberal ideology” contributes to social and cultural divisions, alienating large portions of the population who do not identify with elite-driven narratives on issues like identity, nationalism, and sovereignty. This ideological divide is seen as deepening the UK’s internal conflicts.\\n• Deglobalization and the Return to Nationalism: As part of a broader global trend, the UK is facing the challenges of deglobalization, with potential shifts towards more localized economies and the resurgence of nationalism. Gray suggests this could lead to a reevaluation of the UK’s economic model and its place in the world.\\n• Challenges to Public Services and Welfare: The UK’s public services and welfare state face significant pressures from economic austerity, demographic changes, and political decisions that prioritize market-driven approaches over social cohesion and equity.\\nJohn Gray’s analysis implies that the UK is at a crossroads, facing significant economic, political, and social challenges that could lead to a profound transformation or “collapse” of its current societal model. He suggests that addressing these challenges will require rethinking deeply held assumptions about progress, governance, and the role of the state in regulating the economy and ensuring social welfare.\\n* * *\\nWhy “Dune” is the most worthwhile work of science fiction\\nJohn Gray’s remarks on “Dune” focus on several key aspects that highlight its distinction and depth as a work of science fiction. Here are the specific points he made:\\n• Feudal Future: Gray appreciates “Dune” for its depiction of a “feudal future,” a concept that stands out within the science fiction genre. Unlike many other sci-fi narratives that envision a future dominated by advanced technology and egalitarian societies, “Dune” imagines a future where society has regressed or evolved into a neo-feudal state. This setting is not only unique but also serves as a critique of the assumption that human society will inevitably progress toward more democratic forms of governance.\\n• Complex Social Forms: The novel’s exploration of complex social forms, including loyalty, hierarchy, and religious obligations, resonates with Gray’s interests in the diversity of human social organization and the persistence of pre-modern structures in the future. “Dune” presents a society where these elements are central, challenging the notion that they will be erased by future advancements.\\n• Richness of the Novel’s Universe: Gray highlights the richness of the novel’s universe, which includes elements of shamanism, divination, and practices reminiscent of Roman and pre-feudal societies. This complexity makes “Dune” much more interesting to him than other science fiction works that might adhere more strictly to a linear progression of history or a simplistic view of the future.\\n• Critique of Progress Narratives: Implicit in Gray’s appreciation for “Dune” is a critique of progress narratives common in both science fiction and broader cultural expectations. By presenting a future that revisits feudalism and integrates ancient practices into its social fabric, “Dune” aligns with Gray’s skepticism about the inevitability of progress and the desirability of a future dominated by liberal, technocratic, or homogeneous global cultures.\\n• Science Fiction as a Lens on the Present: Finally, Gray values “Dune” for its ability to use the science fiction genre as a lens to view and critique the present. The novel’s engagement with themes of power, ecology, and society offers insights into contemporary issues, making it a valuable work for understanding human nature and the potential paths of our social and political evolution.\\nJohn Gray’s remarks on “Dune” emphasize its unique contribution to science fiction through its exploration of a feudal future, complex social dynamics, and its critique of progress narratives, making it a work that resonates with his own philosophical inquiries.\\n* * *\\nCriticism of the European Union (EU)\\nJohn Gray’s criticism of the European Union (EU) reflects deep concerns about the structural and ideological underpinnings of the organization. He views the EU as embodying a particular economic and political philosophy that prioritizes market liberalization, deregulation, and the interests of capital over those of labor and broader social welfare. This perspective suggests that the EU, despite its claims of promoting integration and cooperation among European nations, fundamentally serves to entrench a neoliberal economic model. Here’s Gray’s critique:\\n• Neoliberal Economic Policies: Gray argues that the EU has been instrumental in promoting and enforcing neoliberal economic policies across its member states. These policies include the free movement of capital, strict fiscal austerity measures, and the privatization of public services. While these measures are often justified in the name of efficiency and economic growth, Gray contends that they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and corporate interests at the expense of the working class and the public sector.\\n• Constraints on National Economic Policies: One of Gray’s critical points is that the EU’s framework significantly limits the ability of member states to pursue independent economic policies, especially those that might veer towards socialism or social democracy. For example, the EU’s economic governance mechanisms, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, impose strict fiscal rules that discourage expansive public spending or investment in social services. This, according to Gray, stifles the possibility of member states adopting more redistributive economic models that could address inequality and social needs more effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Democratic Deficit: Gray also touches on the issue of the EU’s so-called democratic deficit, where decision-making processes are perceived as being removed from the direct influence or control of the citizens of member states. This criticism is tied to the economic concerns, as the direction of EU policy—especially in economic matters—is often determined by unelected officials in Brussels or influenced heavily by corporate lobbying. The result is a governance structure that, in Gray’s view, prioritizes neoliberal orthodoxy over democratic accountability and the diverse economic preferences of its member populations.\\n• Resistance to Alternative Economic Models: The EU’s commitment to a particular economic paradigm means that alternative models, which might emphasize public welfare, environmental sustainability, or reduced income inequality, face structural and ideological barriers. Countries that have sought to challenge or reform the neoliberal consensus within the EU, either through proposed policy changes or through public referenda, have often been met with resistance from EU institutions. This, Gray argues, reveals a fundamental inflexibility within the EU to accommodate diverse economic philosophies, particularly those that challenge the primacy of the market.\\n• Impact on Social Democracy: Gray sees the EU’s influence as being particularly detrimental to the prospects of social democracy within Europe. By embedding neoliberal policies at the supranational level, the EU effectively narrows the policy space available for social democratic alternatives that seek to balance the market’s efficiencies with social equity and public welfare. This has implications not only for domestic politics within member states but also for the broader ideological landscape of Europe, where social democratic parties have historically played a significant role.\\nJohn Gray’s criticism of the EU centers on its role in cementing a neoliberal economic order that sidelines social democratic principles and limits the autonomy of member states to pursue alternative economic policies. His critique reflects broader debates about the nature of European integration, the balance between market freedoms and social protection, and the democratic legitimacy of EU institutions.\\n* * *\\nPredictions for American Politics\\nJohn Gray’s predictions for American politics involve a deepening legitimation crisis, characterized by increasing political polarization, a potential inward turn, and a consequent reduction in the United States’ global influence and commitments. This perspective is grounded in his broader critique of contemporary political systems and his skepticism towards the sustainability of current political and economic models. Here’s Gray’s outlook:\\n• Deepening Political Polarization: Gray anticipates that political polarization in the United States will continue to intensify, with the country increasingly divided along ideological, cultural, and economic lines. This division is not just a matter of differing opinions but reflects a fundamental rift in how different segments of the population perceive reality, the role of government, and the direction the country should take. Such polarization challenges the very basis of consensus politics and undermines the possibility of effective governance.\\n• Legitimation Crisis: At the heart of Gray’s predictions is a legitimation crisis, wherein a significant portion of the American populace no longer sees the federal government as legitimate or representative of their interests and values. This crisis is exacerbated by controversies over election integrity, the role of media, and deep-seated disagreements over issues such as immigration, gun control, and healthcare. The result is a growing distrust in political institutions and leaders, eroding the foundational trust necessary for a democratic society to function effectively.\\n• Inward Turn and Isolationism: In response to internal divisions and the challenges of maintaining its role as a global superpower, Gray foresees the United States taking a more isolationist stance. This inward turn would manifest in a reluctance to engage in foreign conflicts, a reevaluation of international commitments, and a focus on domestic issues. While not isolationist in the strictest sense, this shift would represent a significant change from the post-World War II era of active American leadership in global affairs.\\n• Reduction in Global Influence: A consequence of this inward turn would be a reduction in the United States’ global influence. As the country becomes more preoccupied with its internal divisions and challenges, its ability and willingness to project power and influence abroad may diminish. This could lead to a reshaping of international alliances, a vacuum of leadership in global governance, and an opportunity for other powers, such as China and Russia, to assert their influence more strongly.\\n• Implications for Democracy: Gray’s predictions also touch on the implications for democracy itself. The legitimation crisis and polarization could lead to challenges in conducting fair and accepted elections, governing effectively, and addressing critical issues. The erosion of democratic norms and institutions could result in a more authoritarian style of governance, as leaders may seek to bypass traditional checks and balances in an effort to implement their agendas amidst deadlock and division.\\n• Societal and Economic Consequences: Beyond politics, Gray suggests that the United States will face significant societal and economic consequences as a result of these trends. Economic inequality, social unrest, and a fraying social fabric could become more pronounced, challenging the country’s ability to maintain cohesion and prosperity.\\nJohn Gray’s vision of the future of American politics is one of increasing challenges to its democratic institutions, societal cohesion, and global standing. His predictions reflect concerns about the sustainability of the current political and economic paradigms in the face of deepening divisions and a potential retreat from the global stage.\\n* * *\\nWhy the current system could be considered worse than feudalism\\nJohn Gray’s analysis suggests that the current system could be considered worse than feudalism in several respects, based on his critique of contemporary political and economic structures.\\n• Economic Inequality and Concentration of Power: Modern neoliberal economies have led to unprecedented levels of economic inequality, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few. This concentration is facilitated and exacerbated by global financial systems and corporate dominance. Unlike feudalism, where obligations and protections were enforced between lords and vassals, today’s economic system often lacks mechanisms to ensure the welfare of those at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.\\n• Loss of Community and Stability: Feudal societies, despite their hierarchical nature, provided a sense of place, role, and stability for most individuals within the system. In contrast, the modern globalized economy has eroded traditional communities and social bonds, leaving individuals feeling alienated and disconnected. The lack of social cohesion and community support networks contributes to a sense of isolation and insecurity that was less prevalent in feudal times.\\n• Environmental Degradation: The relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption in the current system has led to environmental degradation on a scale unimaginable in feudal times. Gray might argue that the exploitation of natural resources without regard to ecological balance or sustainability is a fundamental flaw of the modern economic model, posing existential risks that did not exist in the feudal era.\\n• Technological Displacement and Uncertainty: The rapid pace of technological change in the modern era has led to job displacement and a sense of uncertainty about the future. While technological advancements have brought many benefits, they also pose challenges to employment and social stability that feudal societies did not face. The anxiety and insecurity generated by these changes can be seen as a negative aspect of the modern system.\\n• Democratic Deficits and Governance: Modern democracies face significant challenges, including political polarization, the influence of money in politics, and a perceived detachment of elected officials from the needs of their constituents. These democratic deficits can lead to governance that is less responsive and accountable than the idealized vision of democracy, potentially making modern systems less effective at addressing the needs of the populace than the more straightforward governance structures of feudal times.\\n• Crisis of Legitimation: Gray predicts a legitimation crisis in modern societies, where increasing segments of the population no longer see the political and economic system as legitimate or representative of their interests. This crisis is exacerbated by the aforementioned issues of inequality, alienation, and democratic deficits, contributing to a sense of disillusionment and disenfranchisement that may be considered worse than the more stable, if rigid, social order of feudalism.\\nJohn Gray’s critique suggests that the current system, with its profound economic inequalities, loss of community, environmental degradation, technological disruptions, democratic deficits, and a looming crisis of legitimation, could be seen as offering a less stable and equitable form of social organization than feudalism, despite the latter’s obvious limitations and inequities.\\n* * *\\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic\\nJohn Gray’s discussion about the U.S. opioid epidemic is framed within his broader critique of contemporary society’s failures and the consequences of neoliberal policies. While he does not dedicate a specific section solely to discussing the opioid crisis, his analysis of societal issues provides a context for understanding the epidemic as part of larger social and economic problems. Here’s how Gray’s perspectives relate to the opioid epidemic:\\n• Symptom of Social Malaise: Gray might argue that the opioid epidemic is a symptom of deeper social and economic malaise, including the disintegration of communities, the erosion of stable jobs, and the neglect of public health and welfare systems. It reflects a society where many people feel disconnected, disenfranchised, and without hope for the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Failure of the Neoliberal Model: The crisis can be seen as a consequence of the neoliberal economic model, which prioritizes market freedom and individual responsibility over social welfare and community support. This model has led to vast inequalities and a healthcare system that is often more focused on profit than on patient care, contributing to the widespread availability and prescription of addictive painkillers.\\n• Cultural and Political Neglect: The opioid epidemic underscores a cultural and political neglect of the working class and rural populations, who have been disproportionately affected by economic changes such as deindustrialization. Gray’s analysis would suggest that the epidemic is partly the result of political choices that have marginalized large segments of the population, leaving them vulnerable to addiction as a form of escape from economic and social despair.\\n• Critique of Progress Narratives: Gray’s skepticism towards narratives of inevitable progress and improvement is relevant here. The opioid crisis challenges the idea that technological and economic advancements automatically lead to better lives for all. Instead, it reveals how progress can have uneven and often devastating impacts on different communities.\\n• The Role of Big Pharma: While Gray may not discuss this explicitly in the context of the opioid epidemic, his critique of corporate influence and the commodification of life under neoliberal capitalism is relevant. The aggressive marketing of opioids by pharmaceutical companies, driven by profit motives with insufficient regard for public health, exemplifies the ethical failures of a system that allows corporate interests to override societal well-being.\\n• Response to the Crisis: In line with Gray’s views on the limitations of current political and economic systems to address complex social issues, the opioid epidemic represents a challenge that requires more than just market-based solutions or individual interventions. It calls for a comprehensive societal response, including rethinking healthcare, social support systems, and the economic model that underpins American society.\\nOverall, while John Gray does not specifically focus on the opioid epidemic, his critiques of modern capitalism, neoliberal policies, and the neglect of social welfare provide a framework for understanding the crisis as part of broader societal failures.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

              "{'YANIS VAROUFAKIS': ['\\n \\nIn his book, ‘Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism’, Yanis Varoufakis explores how giant tech firms, both in the US and China are expanding their control over the planet. His analysis is that, whilst material resources certainly matter, the real battle ground is over digital real estate.\\nVaroufakis, a renowned economist and political thinker, presents a future where the digital age has not ushered in the equitable, socialist utopia many had hoped for but has instead birthed a new form of inequality and economic disparity reminiscent of feudal times, yet distinctly marked by digital characteristics.\\nThe foundation of Varoufakis’s argument rests on the observation that the digital giants—companies like Google, Uber, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon—have amassed unprecedented power and wealth, not merely through traditional capitalist means but by establishing monopolies over digital platforms and resources. These companies, according to Varoufakis, are the new lords of a techno-feudal system, where the “cloud” serves as their domain from which they extract rent, much like feudal lords extracted rent from land.\\nThis techno-feudalism is characterized by the concentration of capital and power in the hands of a few, a phenomenon that, while not entirely new, has reached new heights in the digital age. The traditional capitalist notion of competition and market dynamics has given way to a system where access to digital platforms is controlled by these giants, effectively stifling competition and innovation from smaller entities. Europe’s lag in developing its own digital giants exacerbates this issue, making it dependent on American and Chinese tech monopolies.\\nVaroufakis further argues that this concentration of power and capital has significant implications for taxation and the distribution of wealth. Amazon’s operations in Europe, where it generates billions in revenue while paying minimal taxes, exemplify the skewed financial benefits that favor these digital overlords. This, he posits, is not merely a failure of capitalism but a transformation into something more sinister that mirrors feudalism, where societal wealth is siphoned to the top, leaving the masses with fewer economic opportunities and benefits.\\nThe shift to techno-feudalism, as Varoufakis describes, is also marked by a mutation within capitalism itself. Capitalism, in its quest for growth and dominance, has birthed a form of capital—cloud capital—that has ultimately turned on its creator. This cloud capital, controlled by the tech giants, has the power to extract rents and surpluses from both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, redefining the economic landscape and power dynamics.\\nVaroufakis’s insights into the role of digital currencies and payment systems further highlight the transformation underway. The development of digital currencies by China, contrasted with Europe’s lack of similar innovation, underscores the shifting balance of economic power and the emergence of new centers of economic control and influence.\\nIn discussing the geopolitical implications of this shift, Varoufakis points to the rising tensions between the United States and China. The competition is not merely economic but also technological, with both nations vying for dominance in the digital realm. This rivalry, he fears, could lead to conflict, emphasizing the importance of understanding techno-feudalism not just as an economic phenomenon but as a factor reshaping global politics and power structures.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis critiques the liberal notion of the individual, arguing that the pervasive influence of big tech on our lives has eroded the autonomy and privacy that are central to liberal democracy. The data collected by these tech giants on individuals’ preferences, behaviors, and interactions not only fuels their economic dominance but also challenges the very notion of individual freedom and autonomy.\\nIn conclusion, Varoufakis’s discussion of techno-feudalism presents a compelling and concerning vision of the future, where the digital revolution has not liberated humanity but has instead entrenched new forms of inequality and control. The rise of digital giants as the new feudal lords of the 21st century, wielding power over digital realms and extracting economic rents from society, signals a profound shift in the economic and social order. This transition challenges us to rethink our understanding of capitalism, democracy, and freedom in the digital age, urging a reevaluation of the systems and structures that govern our lives.\\n\\n* * *\\nHow big tech has enslaved us according to Yanis Varoufakis?\\nYanis Varoufakis articulates a compelling argument on how big tech has, in essence, enslaved contemporary society, drawing on the concept of techno-feudalism to describe this phenomenon. According to Varoufakis, the evolution of capitalism into this new phase is characterized by several key dynamics:\\n1. Monopolization of the Digital Space: Big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook (now Meta), and Apple have established dominant positions in the digital economy, effectively monopolizing vast swathes of the internet. This dominance allows them to control access to markets, information, and communication platforms, exerting unprecedented power over both consumers and producers.\\n2. Extraction of Digital Rents: Varoufakis argues that these tech giants extract enormous rents from the economy without the traditional exchange of goods and services. By controlling the digital infrastructure — the “cloud” — these companies can impose fees and conditions that extract wealth from both individuals and businesses, funneling profits to an elite few while contributing minimally to public coffers through tax avoidance strategies.\\n3. Surveillance and Data Exploitation: The enslavement also extends to the pervasive surveillance and data mining practices of big tech companies. By harvesting vast amounts of personal data, these entities not only invade privacy but also manipulate consumer behavior and preferences, locking individuals into a cycle of consumption and influence that diminishes autonomy and personal freedom.\\n4. Erosion of Liberal Individualism: Varoufakis highlights how the techno-feudal system undermines the concept of the liberal individual — a cornerstone of democratic society. The constant monitoring and data collection by big tech companies compromise the autonomy and self-determination of individuals, reshaping identities and behaviors through algorithmic manipulation.\\n5. Perpetuation of Inequality: The techno-feudal model exacerbates inequality by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the tech oligarchs while the majority of society sees diminishing economic prospects and eroding rights. This concentration of power mirrors feudal structures, where lords wielded control over land and serfs, but in the modern context, it’s digital territory and data.\\n6. Dependency and Powerlessness: Society’s increasing dependency on digital platforms for economic, social, and political engagement has rendered individuals and smaller entities powerless against the might of big tech. This dependency is likened to feudal vassalage, where serfs had no choice but to submit to the lords’ authority.\\n7. Geopolitical Implications: Varoufakis also delves into the geopolitical ramifications of big tech’s rise, particularly the tension between the U.S. and China, as both nations vie for technological and economic supremacy. This rivalry underscores the global impact of techno-feudalism, with Europe lagging behind and losing relevance in the new digital order.\\nIn summary, Yanis Varoufakis paints a stark picture of a society ensnared by the technological and economic might of big tech companies. This enslavement, according to his analysis, is not just a matter of economic dominance but extends to the very fabric of individual freedom, societal structure, and global power dynamics, signaling a profound shift from traditional capitalist models to a new era of techno-feudalism.\\n* * *\\nJeff Bezos and Amazon\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Jeff Bezos within the broader narrative of techno-feudalism, highlighting how Bezos, through Amazon, exemplifies the shift from traditional capitalist practices to a new era where digital platforms and cloud capital dominate. Bezos is portrayed as a modern feudal lord of the digital age, where his control over Amazon’s vast online marketplace and cloud services positions him at the forefront of this economic transformation.\\nVaroufakis points out that Amazon, under Bezos’s leadership, has become more than just an online retailer; it is a massive platform that controls significant portions of the digital economy, from e-commerce to cloud computing services. This control allows Amazon to extract rents from other businesses that rely on its platform to reach consumers, a practice reminiscent of feudal lords extracting rent from their lands. The comparison to feudalism is used to illustrate the power dynamics in the digital economy, where platform owners like Bezos wield immense power over the market, shaping economic activities and influencing the distribution of wealth.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis criticizes the tax practices associated with companies like Amazon. He highlights how Amazon generates billions in revenue, particularly in Europe, without contributing a proportionate amount in taxes. This situation exacerbates economic inequalities and underscores the challenges that digital economies pose to traditional frameworks of taxation and regulation.\\nThe discussion around Bezos and Amazon serves to underline the broader themes of techno-feudalism that Varoufakis explores. It reflects concerns about the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few digital platform owners, the erosion of traditional market dynamics, and the societal implications of these shifts, including impacts on privacy, labor, and democracy. Through the example of Bezos, Varoufakis calls attention to the urgent need to address these challenges and rethink the governance of digital economies to ensure a more equitable and democratic future.\\n\\n\\n\\n* * *\\nElon Musk\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Elon Musk within the context of the broader shift towards techno-feudalism, highlighting Musk’s ambitions and the strategic moves he has made in the tech world as emblematic of the new forms of power and control emerging in the digital age. Musk, known for his ventures such as Tesla and his interest in acquiring Twitter, serves as a case study for Varoufakis’s arguments about cloud capital and its impact on society.\\nVaroufakis points out that Elon Musk’s ventures, particularly Tesla, are not just about manufacturing electric vehicles but are deeply integrated with digital technologies and cloud capital. Tesla cars, connected to the cloud, collect vast amounts of data on their users’ behaviors, preferences, and movements. This data collection extends beyond the automotive industry, touching on aspects of digital surveillance and data monetization that are central to techno-feudalism. Musk’s desire to replicate a platform like WeChat, which combines social media, messaging, payments, and other services into a single ecosystem, is highlighted as an attempt to further integrate and control various aspects of digital and physical life.\\nThe discussion around Musk and his interest in platforms like Twitter underscores a broader trend where tech entrepreneurs are not just content creators or service providers but are becoming the new lords of the digital realm. They wield significant power over the digital landscapes they control, much like feudal lords once controlled their lands and the people within them. This comparison is used to illustrate the transformation of capital in the digital age, where ownership of digital platforms and the data they generate becomes a source of unprecedented power and wealth.\\nVaroufakis’s insights into Musk’s activities reflect concerns over the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants and entrepreneurs. This concentration is seen as a fundamental feature of techno-feudalism, where digital platforms become new fiefs, and their owners, the new feudal lords, exert significant influence over the economy, society, and even the political landscape. Musk’s ventures exemplify how technology and capital are merging to create new forms of economic and social organization, challenging traditional notions of capitalism and prompting a reevaluation of our future in a digitally dominated world.\\n* * *\\nTesla\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Tesla within the context of the transition from traditional capitalism to what he terms “techno-feudalism,” emphasizing the role of companies like Tesla in this new economic landscape. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, is not just an automaker but a tech company that exemplifies the fusion of technology with traditional manufacturing, reshaping economic relationships and production methods. Here’s how Varoufakis frames Tesla in his analysis:\\nTesla as a Cloud Company\\nVaroufakis highlights that Tesla’s value and innovation extend beyond the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Tesla is deeply integrated into the cloud, leveraging data collection, connectivity, and software to enhance its vehicles and customer experience. This integration allows Tesla to continuously update and improve its vehicles after purchase, a stark contrast to traditional automakers whose products remain static post-sale.\\nData and Value Extraction\\nTesla’s vehicles are equipped with a range of sensors and connectivity features that collect vast amounts of data on driving habits, preferences, and vehicle performance. This data is not just used to refine Tesla’s products but also represents a form of cloud capital. According to Varoufakis, this positions Tesla similarly to big tech firms that extract value through data, distinguishing it from conventional car manufacturers. Tesla’s business model, therefore, embodies the techno-feudalism thesis, where value is increasingly derived from digital and data-driven domains rather than solely physical goods.\\nThe Cloud as Capital\\nVaroufakis uses Tesla as an example to illustrate his broader point that the cloud has become a form of capital in itself. In this new economy, companies like Tesla that can harness cloud-based data and platforms possess a significant competitive advantage. They are not just selling products but are also engaging in the extraction of data-driven value, a characteristic feature of techno-feudalism.\\nImpact on Traditional Industry\\nTesla’s rise and its approach to vehicle production and data utilization signify a shift in how value is created and captured in the economy. This shift challenges traditional industrial companies, which are more reliant on physical production and less integrated with digital technologies. Varoufakis suggests that companies unable to adapt to this cloud-based model may find themselves at a disadvantage, further accelerating the divide between traditional capitalism and the emerging techno-feudal system.\\nTesla and the Future of Work\\nThe discussion around Tesla also touches on broader implications for the future of work and the economy. As companies leverage cloud capital and data, the nature of work, value creation, and economic power structures are transformed. This raises questions about labor rights, data privacy, and the distribution of economic benefits in a world where a few tech giants could dominate much of the economic landscape.\\nVaroufakis’s mention of Tesla serves to exemplify the broader economic transformation towards techno-feudalism, where the integration of technology, data, and cloud platforms redefines value creation and economic power. Tesla, in this analysis, is not merely an automotive company but a symbol of the shift towards a new economic order dominated by digital technologies and data-driven business models.\\n* * *\\nFree Payments (WeChat Pay and Alipay)\\nIn the discussion, Yanis Varoufakis touches upon the concept of “free payments” in the context of digital platforms and technologies, particularly referencing China’s advancements in this area. This concept is part of his broader analysis of techno-feudalism and how certain technological innovations are reshaping economic and social relations.\\nThe Concept of Free Payments\\nFree payments refer to the ability to conduct financial transactions without incurring traditional banking fees, facilitated by digital platforms that bypass conventional financial institutions. This innovation is significant in the context of big tech’s encroachment into the financial sector, offering a glimpse into how these companies are leveraging technology to create alternative financial ecosystems that challenge the status quo.\\nCase Study: China’s Digital Currency and Payment Systems\\nVaroufakis highlights China’s development of digital currency and payment platforms, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, as prime examples of the free payments phenomenon. These platforms allow users to make transactions directly from their smartphones, seamlessly integrating payment capabilities into a broader digital ecosystem that includes social media, e-commerce, and more. The critical innovation here is the elimination of transaction fees typically charged by banks, thereby democratizing access to digital financial services and enhancing the efficiency of economic transactions.\\nImplications of Free Payments\\n1. Disruption of Traditional Banking: The rise of free payment platforms challenges the business model of traditional banks, which rely on transaction fees as a significant revenue source. This shift could lead to a reconfiguration of the banking industry, pushing it toward more innovative and user-friendly services.\\n2. Centralization of Power: While free payments democratize access to financial services, they also concentrate power in the hands of platform operators, like big tech firms, who control the digital infrastructure facilitating these transactions. This centralization raises concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential for abuse of market dominance.\\n3. Economic and Social Transformation: The widespread adoption of free payment technologies can transform economies, particularly in developing countries where traditional banking services are limited. By enabling more efficient and inclusive financial transactions, these technologies can spur economic growth and social development.\\n4. Regulatory Challenges: The emergence of free payment systems poses significant regulatory challenges, as governments and financial authorities grapple with issues of privacy, cybersecurity, financial stability, and competition. The global nature of big tech companies further complicates regulatory efforts, requiring international cooperation to address these challenges effectively.\\n5. Strategic Geopolitical Considerations: Varoufakis also points out the geopolitical dimensions of free payment systems, particularly in the context of U.S.-China rivalry. The development of digital currencies and payment platforms is part of a broader contest for technological supremacy, with implications for global economic leadership and strategic influence.\\nYanis Varoufakis’s discussion of free payments within the framework of techno-feudalism underscores the transformative potential of digital financial technologies. While these innovations offer opportunities for economic empowerment and efficiency, they also raise critical questions about privacy, power concentration, and the future of financial systems in a digitally dominated world. The evolution of free payment systems exemplifies the broader shifts in economic and social relations that Varoufakis associates with the transition to a new era of techno-feudalism.\\n* * *\\nBill Clinton\\nYanis Varoufakis mentions Bill Clinton in the context of discussing the evolution of capitalism and the regulatory changes that occurred during Clinton’s presidency, which had significant implications for the financial sector and broader economic landscape. Clinton’s tenure in the 1990s is notable for several policies that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the deregulation of financial markets, aspects that Varoufakis critiques in his analysis of the shift towards techno-feudalism.\\nKey Points Related to Clinton’s Policies:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Deregulation of the Financial Sector: One of the hallmark policies of the Clinton administration was the deregulation of the financial industry. This included the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act through the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which removed the separation between commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance services. This deregulation is often cited as a factor that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the increased risk-taking behavior of financial institutions, leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.\\n2. Promotion of Financialization: The Clinton administration’s policies are seen as facilitating the financialization of the American economy, a process by which financial services became a more dominant sector, influencing economic policy and corporate strategies. This shift towards financialization is characterized by an increased role of financial markets, institutions, and motives in the economy, contributing to the phenomena that Varoufakis identifies as part of the movement towards techno-feudalism.\\n3. Global Economic Policies: Clinton’s tenure also saw the promotion of globalization and free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While intended to boost economic growth through increased trade, these policies also had wide-ranging effects on labor markets and the distribution of economic power, themes that are central to Varoufakis’s critique of the current economic order.\\n4. Impact on Inequality: Varoufakis and other critics argue that the economic policies of the Clinton era, particularly those related to deregulation and financialization, have contributed to rising inequality. They assert that these policies benefited financial elites and the tech oligarchs at the expense of the broader population, exacerbating economic disparities.\\nIn mentioning Clinton, Varoufakis underscores the significance of political and regulatory decisions in shaping the economic landscape, leading to the conditions that he describes as techno-feudalism. Clinton’s presidency is cited as a pivotal period when policies that favored deregulation and financialization were implemented, setting the stage for the economic challenges and transformations that Varoufakis explores in his work.\\n* * *\\nSurveillance and privacy\\nYanis Varoufakis paints a concerning picture of how digital platforms and cloud capital have fundamentally altered the nature of individual autonomy and privacy. He argues that the rise of big tech companies and their control over digital infrastructure have led to an unprecedented level of surveillance, far surpassing anything imagined in traditional or even dystopian views of state surveillance.\\nHe highlights how these companies collect vast amounts of data on individuals’ behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This data collection is not incidental but central to the business models of these platforms, which rely on harvesting personal information to generate profits through targeted advertising, selling data to third parties, or refining their services to increase user engagement and dependence.\\nThe economist critically examines the relationship between individuals and digital platforms, especially how platforms like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s search engine are designed to learn from users, only to use that information to influence and modify their behavior in return. This cycle of data collection and behavioral influence challenges the liberal notion of the autonomous individual, suggesting that our choices and preferences are increasingly shaped by algorithms and corporate interests rather than genuine personal freedom.\\nVaroufakis’s analysis extends to the societal implications of this surveillance economy, questioning the viability of privacy in a world where personal data is the primary currency. He suggests that the very concept of the liberal individual—a cornerstone of democratic societies—is under threat in an era where people’s thoughts, movements, and desires are constantly monitored and commodified by tech giants.\\nMoreover, he touches on the psychological impact of living under constant surveillance, where individuals must curate their online presence with the awareness that future employers, governments, or malicious actors might scrutinize their digital footprints. This reality erodes the distinction between public and private life, forcing individuals to self-censor or alter their behavior not just in digital spaces but in all aspects of life, due to the omnipresence of digital surveillance.\\nIn essence, Varoufakis warns that techno-feudalism, with its foundation in cloud capital and digital platforms, has ushered in an era where surveillance and the erosion of privacy are not just byproducts but essential mechanisms of power and control. This shift has profound implications for democracy, freedom, and human dignity, challenging us to reconsider the values and structures that underpin our societies in the digital age.\\n* * *\\nEurope\\nYanis Varoufakis expresses a stark and sobering view on Europe’s position in the emerging global order dominated by techno-feudalism. He believes that Europe has become increasingly irrelevant on the world stage, particularly in the face of rising powers like China and the United States, which have developed significant technological and economic dominance through their control of cloud capital and digital platforms. Europe’s lack of comparable digital giants leaves it at a significant disadvantage, making it dependent on American and Chinese tech monopolies for digital infrastructure and services.\\nVaroufakis points out that Europe does not have its own equivalents to Google, Facebook, Uber, Apple, or Amazon. This absence means that European companies and economies are forced to operate within the digital and economic ecosystems controlled by these foreign giants, effectively rendering Europe a vassal to their techno-feudal empires. This dependency is not just an economic concern but also a geopolitical weakness, as Europe lacks the technological sovereignty to assert itself in the digital age.\\nThe conversation highlights the significant tax contributions—or the lack thereof—made by tech giants in Europe. Amazon’s operations serve as a prime example, with the company making billions in revenue within Europe while paying minimal taxes. This situation underscores the economic disparities that techno-feudalism exacerbates, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few non-European entities, while European states and citizens are left with diminishing returns and influence.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis discusses the geopolitical implications of Europe’s diminished role, particularly in the context of rising tensions between the United States and China. He suggests that Europe’s political and economic fragmentation, combined with its technological lag, renders it a secondary player in global affairs. The continent’s inability to present a unified or powerful front in international negotiations or conflicts, such as the situation in Ukraine, exemplifies its declining influence.\\nVaroufakis’s perspective on Europe is not just an economic critique but also a call to recognize the profound transformations underway in the global order. He argues that Europe’s future is at risk unless it can navigate the challenges of techno-feudalism, reclaim technological sovereignty, and redefine its role in a world where digital platforms and cloud capital are reshaping economies, societies, and geopolitics.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",
              " 'JOHN GRAY': ['\\n \\nCrossroads of Empire: John Gray’s Vision of Political Realignment and the Fate of the West\\nJohn Gray, the prolific political philosopher, has long been a figure of intrigue and controversy. Over the past half-century, Gray has navigated the intellectual currents of political thought, never comfortably fitting into a single ideological box. His ability to provoke thought across the political spectrum is perhaps best encapsulated in his latest work, which examines the changing fortunes of the West through a prism of revived historical paradigms: feudalism, religious orthodoxy, and ultra-nationalism.\\nGray’s central thesis challenges the modern consensus on growth and progress, suggesting that neither are guaranteed nor inevitable. This perspective underpins his broader critique of globalization and liberal capitalism, positions that have brought him both acclaim and criticism. His skepticism towards the West’s commitment to these ideologies has proven prescient, with his early critiques of globalization and the pitfalls of military occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq now widely acknowledged as accurate.\\nIn his recent book, The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism, Gray turns his attention to what he perceives as the declining trajectory of Western dominance, proposing that the future may see a return to older forms of social organization and governance. This outlook is deeply intertwined with his critique of contemporary liberal policies, which he argues have inadvertently fueled the rise of populism. Gray sees populism not as an aberration but as a direct backlash against the social disruptions caused by liberal economic and cultural policies.\\nCentral to Gray’s analysis is the idea that Western liberalism, with its emphasis on individual autonomy and economic deregulation, has reached a critical juncture. He suggests that the crises facing the West today are symptomatic of deeper ideological failures. These include a misplaced faith in the universality of liberal democracy and capitalism, which, in his view, have led to increasing social fragmentation and economic inequality. Gray argues that the responses to these crises, from both the political left and right, have been largely inadequate, mired in outdated modes of thinking that fail to address the root causes of contemporary malaise.\\nMoreover, Gray posits that the current moment represents a crossroads for the West, one that requires a fundamental reevaluation of its values and political systems. He envisions a future in which the West might see a resurgence of forms of social organization that have historically been associated with pre-modern societies. This includes a revival of feudalistic structures, a return to more orthodox religious practices, and a strengthening of ultra-nationalist sentiments. According to Gray, these developments are not necessarily regressive but reflect a complex interplay of historical, cultural, and economic forces that challenge the linear conception of history as a progression towards liberal democracy and capitalism.\\nGray’s critique extends beyond mere political analysis, delving into the philosophical underpinnings of Western thought. He challenges the Enlightenment belief in reason and progress, suggesting that such ideals have led to an overconfidence in the ability of liberal democracy and capitalism to address the fundamental challenges of human existence. Instead, Gray calls for a more nuanced understanding of human nature and history, one that recognizes the limitations of rationalism and the inevitability of cyclical patterns of social and political organization.\\nIn conclusion, John Gray’s work represents a provocative challenge to the conventional wisdom regarding the West’s past, present, and future. By drawing on a wide array of historical, philosophical, and political insights, Gray offers a compelling critique of the assumptions that have shaped Western thought for centuries. His analysis suggests that the West may be on the cusp of a profound transformation, one that could see the resurgence of older forms of social organization and governance. Whether one agrees with Gray’s conclusions or not, his work undeniably provides a rich source of reflection on the complexities of contemporary political life and the unpredictable nature of historical change.\\n\\n* * *\\nAaron Bastani’s interview with John Gray covers a broad range of topics, delving into his critiques of globalization, liberalism, and the current political and economic trajectory of the West. Here are the key points discussed:\\n• Critique of Globalization and Liberalism: Gray criticized the optimistic belief in inevitable globalization and liberal democracy, arguing that these trends are neither inevitable nor universally beneficial. His skepticism towards globalization, which he expressed in his earlier work, was met with widespread criticism at the time but has since been vindicated by events.\\n• Skepticism Towards Progress: He challenges the notion of inevitable progress and growth, suggesting that history is cyclical rather than linear, and that we may be returning to older forms of living and governance, such as feudalism, ultra-nationalism, and religious orthodoxy.\\n• Critique of Western Policies and Populism: Gray links the rise of populism to the social disruptions caused by policies from liberal elites, arguing they fail to see the connection between their actions and the political blowback they receive.\\nViews on the Future of the West: He predicts a shift away from the ideologies and structures that have dominated recent decades, suggesting a return to more traditional, possibly pre-modern, forms of social organization.\\n• The Role of Religion and Nationalism: Contrary to the expectations of liberal universalism, Gray highlights the resurgence of nationalism and religion as central forces in global politics, underscoring their role in the collapse of communism and the ongoing resistance to liberal hegemony.\\n• Economic Critiques: Gray criticizes the current economic system, predicting further fragmentation and the potential for a return to more localized, less globalized economic models. He sees the current trend towards deglobalization as an acknowledgment of the failures of the globalizing project.\\n• Criticism of the European Union (EU): He views the EU as a flawed project, arguing that it is designed to prevent the emergence of socialism or moderate social democracy, favoring a neoliberal economic model instead.\\n• Hyper-Liberal Ideology and its Consequences: Gray critiques the rise of what he calls “hyper-liberal ideology,” seeing it as an extension of Western liberalism that paradoxically seeks to undermine Western values. He associates it with the elite’s attempt to secure power amidst capitalism’s failures.\\n• Predictions for American Politics: Gray foresees a legitimation crisis in the United States, with increasing political polarization and a potential inward turn, reducing its global influence and commitments.\\n• Views on Political and Ethical Choices: He discusses the inevitability of tragic choices in politics, where any action or inaction involves irreparable losses or wrongs, challenging the notion that perfect solutions exist for societal problems.\\nGray’s perspective offers a critical and often contrarian view of contemporary political and economic trends, questioning the assumptions underlying liberal democracy, globalization, and the notion of inevitable progress.\\n* * *\\nThe nonsense of centrism\\nJohn Gray’s critique of centrism is multifaceted and reflects his broader skepticism towards dominant political ideologies and narratives. When he refers to the “nonsense of centrism,” he is critiquing a political stance that positions itself as a moderate or middle ground between the perceived extremes of left and right politics. Here are the key aspects of Gray’s critique:\\n• Centrism as a Hollow Ideology: Gray views centrism not as a coherent ideology with substantive policies but as a political stance that often lacks depth and fails to address the underlying issues facing society. Centrists claim to offer pragmatic solutions, yet their policies may be disconnected from the realities of widespread inequality, social fragmentation, and the dissatisfaction of large segments of the population.\\n• Failure to Address Structural Problems: Centrism, in Gray’s view, often represents an attempt to maintain the status quo by making minor adjustments rather than tackling the root causes of economic and social issues. This approach can be seen as inadequate in times of significant upheaval or when faced with systemic challenges, such as those brought about by globalization, technological change, and environmental crises.\\n• The Illusion of a Non-ideological Stance: Centrists often claim to be above the fray of ideological battles, positioning themselves as rational and evidence-based arbiters. However, Gray would argue that this is an illusion and that centrism itself is ideologically driven, promoting a particular vision of society that upholds existing power structures and economic models.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Disconnection from Popular Sentiments: Gray suggests that centrism is often out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of ordinary people. By focusing on a narrow band of policies deemed acceptable by political and economic elites, centrists can alienate large portions of the electorate who feel their voices and concerns are not being heard.\\n• Convergence of Political Parties: One consequence of centrism, according to Gray, is the convergence of major political parties around a set of neoliberal policies, reducing the diversity of political options available to voters. This convergence can lead to voter apathy and disillusionment with the political process, as significant differences between parties become harder to discern.\\n• Populism as a Reaction to Centrism: Gray links the rise of populism, in part, to the failures of centrism. Populist movements can be seen as a backlash against the perceived elitism and ineffectiveness of centrist policies, tapping into feelings of neglect and disenfranchisement among the public.\\nJohn Gray’s critique of centrism is that it fails to adequately address the complex challenges facing modern societies, often serves to preserve the status quo at the expense of meaningful change, and can contribute to political polarization and the rise of populist movements by neglecting the concerns of large segments of the population.\\n* * *\\nHow the UK is facing Collapse, according to John Gray?\\nJohn Gray’s insights on the potential for the UK’s collapse are interwoven with his broader critiques of globalization, liberal ideology, and the political and economic trajectories of Western societies. While he doesn’t predict a literal collapse in the sense of a sudden disintegration, his analysis suggests a series of challenges and transformations that could fundamentally alter the UK’s future stability and prosperity. Key themes from Gray’s perspective include:\\n• Economic Fragility and Inequality: Gray highlights the UK’s vulnerability due to its highly financialized economy and dependence on global financial markets. He suggests that the economic model adopted by the UK, heavily reliant on finance and service industries, is susceptible to global economic shocks and crises, leading to increased inequality and social fragmentation.\\n• Political Disintegration and Legitimation Crisis: He argues that the UK is experiencing a crisis of legitimacy, where increasing segments of the population no longer feel represented by the political establishment. This is exacerbated by the polarization over issues like Brexit and the rise of nationalist sentiments in Scotland and Northern Ireland, threatening the unity of the United Kingdom.\\n• Impact of Brexit: Gray discusses Brexit as a symptom of deeper societal divides and an example of the elite’s failure to anticipate or understand the consequences of their policies. The process of leaving the EU has exposed and intensified existing political and economic vulnerabilities, including challenges to the UK’s global standing and economic stability.\\n• Social and Cultural Divisions: The rise of what Gray terms “hyper-liberal ideology” contributes to social and cultural divisions, alienating large portions of the population who do not identify with elite-driven narratives on issues like identity, nationalism, and sovereignty. This ideological divide is seen as deepening the UK’s internal conflicts.\\n• Deglobalization and the Return to Nationalism: As part of a broader global trend, the UK is facing the challenges of deglobalization, with potential shifts towards more localized economies and the resurgence of nationalism. Gray suggests this could lead to a reevaluation of the UK’s economic model and its place in the world.\\n• Challenges to Public Services and Welfare: The UK’s public services and welfare state face significant pressures from economic austerity, demographic changes, and political decisions that prioritize market-driven approaches over social cohesion and equity.\\nJohn Gray’s analysis implies that the UK is at a crossroads, facing significant economic, political, and social challenges that could lead to a profound transformation or “collapse” of its current societal model. He suggests that addressing these challenges will require rethinking deeply held assumptions about progress, governance, and the role of the state in regulating the economy and ensuring social welfare.\\n* * *\\nWhy “Dune” is the most worthwhile work of science fiction\\nJohn Gray’s remarks on “Dune” focus on several key aspects that highlight its distinction and depth as a work of science fiction. Here are the specific points he made:\\n• Feudal Future: Gray appreciates “Dune” for its depiction of a “feudal future,” a concept that stands out within the science fiction genre. Unlike many other sci-fi narratives that envision a future dominated by advanced technology and egalitarian societies, “Dune” imagines a future where society has regressed or evolved into a neo-feudal state. This setting is not only unique but also serves as a critique of the assumption that human society will inevitably progress toward more democratic forms of governance.\\n• Complex Social Forms: The novel’s exploration of complex social forms, including loyalty, hierarchy, and religious obligations, resonates with Gray’s interests in the diversity of human social organization and the persistence of pre-modern structures in the future. “Dune” presents a society where these elements are central, challenging the notion that they will be erased by future advancements.\\n• Richness of the Novel’s Universe: Gray highlights the richness of the novel’s universe, which includes elements of shamanism, divination, and practices reminiscent of Roman and pre-feudal societies. This complexity makes “Dune” much more interesting to him than other science fiction works that might adhere more strictly to a linear progression of history or a simplistic view of the future.\\n• Critique of Progress Narratives: Implicit in Gray’s appreciation for “Dune” is a critique of progress narratives common in both science fiction and broader cultural expectations. By presenting a future that revisits feudalism and integrates ancient practices into its social fabric, “Dune” aligns with Gray’s skepticism about the inevitability of progress and the desirability of a future dominated by liberal, technocratic, or homogeneous global cultures.\\n• Science Fiction as a Lens on the Present: Finally, Gray values “Dune” for its ability to use the science fiction genre as a lens to view and critique the present. The novel’s engagement with themes of power, ecology, and society offers insights into contemporary issues, making it a valuable work for understanding human nature and the potential paths of our social and political evolution.\\nJohn Gray’s remarks on “Dune” emphasize its unique contribution to science fiction through its exploration of a feudal future, complex social dynamics, and its critique of progress narratives, making it a work that resonates with his own philosophical inquiries.\\n* * *\\nCriticism of the European Union (EU)\\nJohn Gray’s criticism of the European Union (EU) reflects deep concerns about the structural and ideological underpinnings of the organization. He views the EU as embodying a particular economic and political philosophy that prioritizes market liberalization, deregulation, and the interests of capital over those of labor and broader social welfare. This perspective suggests that the EU, despite its claims of promoting integration and cooperation among European nations, fundamentally serves to entrench a neoliberal economic model. Here’s Gray’s critique:\\n• Neoliberal Economic Policies: Gray argues that the EU has been instrumental in promoting and enforcing neoliberal economic policies across its member states. These policies include the free movement of capital, strict fiscal austerity measures, and the privatization of public services. While these measures are often justified in the name of efficiency and economic growth, Gray contends that they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and corporate interests at the expense of the working class and the public sector.\\n• Constraints on National Economic Policies: One of Gray’s critical points is that the EU’s framework significantly limits the ability of member states to pursue independent economic policies, especially those that might veer towards socialism or social democracy. For example, the EU’s economic governance mechanisms, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, impose strict fiscal rules that discourage expansive public spending or investment in social services. This, according to Gray, stifles the possibility of member states adopting more redistributive economic models that could address inequality and social needs more effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Democratic Deficit: Gray also touches on the issue of the EU’s so-called democratic deficit, where decision-making processes are perceived as being removed from the direct influence or control of the citizens of member states. This criticism is tied to the economic concerns, as the direction of EU policy—especially in economic matters—is often determined by unelected officials in Brussels or influenced heavily by corporate lobbying. The result is a governance structure that, in Gray’s view, prioritizes neoliberal orthodoxy over democratic accountability and the diverse economic preferences of its member populations.\\n• Resistance to Alternative Economic Models: The EU’s commitment to a particular economic paradigm means that alternative models, which might emphasize public welfare, environmental sustainability, or reduced income inequality, face structural and ideological barriers. Countries that have sought to challenge or reform the neoliberal consensus within the EU, either through proposed policy changes or through public referenda, have often been met with resistance from EU institutions. This, Gray argues, reveals a fundamental inflexibility within the EU to accommodate diverse economic philosophies, particularly those that challenge the primacy of the market.\\n• Impact on Social Democracy: Gray sees the EU’s influence as being particularly detrimental to the prospects of social democracy within Europe. By embedding neoliberal policies at the supranational level, the EU effectively narrows the policy space available for social democratic alternatives that seek to balance the market’s efficiencies with social equity and public welfare. This has implications not only for domestic politics within member states but also for the broader ideological landscape of Europe, where social democratic parties have historically played a significant role.\\nJohn Gray’s criticism of the EU centers on its role in cementing a neoliberal economic order that sidelines social democratic principles and limits the autonomy of member states to pursue alternative economic policies. His critique reflects broader debates about the nature of European integration, the balance between market freedoms and social protection, and the democratic legitimacy of EU institutions.\\n* * *\\nPredictions for American Politics\\nJohn Gray’s predictions for American politics involve a deepening legitimation crisis, characterized by increasing political polarization, a potential inward turn, and a consequent reduction in the United States’ global influence and commitments. This perspective is grounded in his broader critique of contemporary political systems and his skepticism towards the sustainability of current political and economic models. Here’s Gray’s outlook:\\n• Deepening Political Polarization: Gray anticipates that political polarization in the United States will continue to intensify, with the country increasingly divided along ideological, cultural, and economic lines. This division is not just a matter of differing opinions but reflects a fundamental rift in how different segments of the population perceive reality, the role of government, and the direction the country should take. Such polarization challenges the very basis of consensus politics and undermines the possibility of effective governance.\\n• Legitimation Crisis: At the heart of Gray’s predictions is a legitimation crisis, wherein a significant portion of the American populace no longer sees the federal government as legitimate or representative of their interests and values. This crisis is exacerbated by controversies over election integrity, the role of media, and deep-seated disagreements over issues such as immigration, gun control, and healthcare. The result is a growing distrust in political institutions and leaders, eroding the foundational trust necessary for a democratic society to function effectively.\\n• Inward Turn and Isolationism: In response to internal divisions and the challenges of maintaining its role as a global superpower, Gray foresees the United States taking a more isolationist stance. This inward turn would manifest in a reluctance to engage in foreign conflicts, a reevaluation of international commitments, and a focus on domestic issues. While not isolationist in the strictest sense, this shift would represent a significant change from the post-World War II era of active American leadership in global affairs.\\n• Reduction in Global Influence: A consequence of this inward turn would be a reduction in the United States’ global influence. As the country becomes more preoccupied with its internal divisions and challenges, its ability and willingness to project power and influence abroad may diminish. This could lead to a reshaping of international alliances, a vacuum of leadership in global governance, and an opportunity for other powers, such as China and Russia, to assert their influence more strongly.\\n• Implications for Democracy: Gray’s predictions also touch on the implications for democracy itself. The legitimation crisis and polarization could lead to challenges in conducting fair and accepted elections, governing effectively, and addressing critical issues. The erosion of democratic norms and institutions could result in a more authoritarian style of governance, as leaders may seek to bypass traditional checks and balances in an effort to implement their agendas amidst deadlock and division.\\n• Societal and Economic Consequences: Beyond politics, Gray suggests that the United States will face significant societal and economic consequences as a result of these trends. Economic inequality, social unrest, and a fraying social fabric could become more pronounced, challenging the country’s ability to maintain cohesion and prosperity.\\nJohn Gray’s vision of the future of American politics is one of increasing challenges to its democratic institutions, societal cohesion, and global standing. His predictions reflect concerns about the sustainability of the current political and economic paradigms in the face of deepening divisions and a potential retreat from the global stage.\\n* * *\\nWhy the current system could be considered worse than feudalism\\nJohn Gray’s analysis suggests that the current system could be considered worse than feudalism in several respects, based on his critique of contemporary political and economic structures.\\n• Economic Inequality and Concentration of Power: Modern neoliberal economies have led to unprecedented levels of economic inequality, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few. This concentration is facilitated and exacerbated by global financial systems and corporate dominance. Unlike feudalism, where obligations and protections were enforced between lords and vassals, today’s economic system often lacks mechanisms to ensure the welfare of those at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.\\n• Loss of Community and Stability: Feudal societies, despite their hierarchical nature, provided a sense of place, role, and stability for most individuals within the system. In contrast, the modern globalized economy has eroded traditional communities and social bonds, leaving individuals feeling alienated and disconnected. The lack of social cohesion and community support networks contributes to a sense of isolation and insecurity that was less prevalent in feudal times.\\n• Environmental Degradation: The relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption in the current system has led to environmental degradation on a scale unimaginable in feudal times. Gray might argue that the exploitation of natural resources without regard to ecological balance or sustainability is a fundamental flaw of the modern economic model, posing existential risks that did not exist in the feudal era.\\n• Technological Displacement and Uncertainty: The rapid pace of technological change in the modern era has led to job displacement and a sense of uncertainty about the future. While technological advancements have brought many benefits, they also pose challenges to employment and social stability that feudal societies did not face. The anxiety and insecurity generated by these changes can be seen as a negative aspect of the modern system.\\n• Democratic Deficits and Governance: Modern democracies face significant challenges, including political polarization, the influence of money in politics, and a perceived detachment of elected officials from the needs of their constituents. These democratic deficits can lead to governance that is less responsive and accountable than the idealized vision of democracy, potentially making modern systems less effective at addressing the needs of the populace than the more straightforward governance structures of feudal times.\\n• Crisis of Legitimation: Gray predicts a legitimation crisis in modern societies, where increasing segments of the population no longer see the political and economic system as legitimate or representative of their interests. This crisis is exacerbated by the aforementioned issues of inequality, alienation, and democratic deficits, contributing to a sense of disillusionment and disenfranchisement that may be considered worse than the more stable, if rigid, social order of feudalism.\\nJohn Gray’s critique suggests that the current system, with its profound economic inequalities, loss of community, environmental degradation, technological disruptions, democratic deficits, and a looming crisis of legitimation, could be seen as offering a less stable and equitable form of social organization than feudalism, despite the latter’s obvious limitations and inequities.\\n* * *\\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic\\nJohn Gray’s discussion about the U.S. opioid epidemic is framed within his broader critique of contemporary society’s failures and the consequences of neoliberal policies. While he does not dedicate a specific section solely to discussing the opioid crisis, his analysis of societal issues provides a context for understanding the epidemic as part of larger social and economic problems. Here’s how Gray’s perspectives relate to the opioid epidemic:\\n• Symptom of Social Malaise: Gray might argue that the opioid epidemic is a symptom of deeper social and economic malaise, including the disintegration of communities, the erosion of stable jobs, and the neglect of public health and welfare systems. It reflects a society where many people feel disconnected, disenfranchised, and without hope for the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n• Failure of the Neoliberal Model: The crisis can be seen as a consequence of the neoliberal economic model, which prioritizes market freedom and individual responsibility over social welfare and community support. This model has led to vast inequalities and a healthcare system that is often more focused on profit than on patient care, contributing to the widespread availability and prescription of addictive painkillers.\\n• Cultural and Political Neglect: The opioid epidemic underscores a cultural and political neglect of the working class and rural populations, who have been disproportionately affected by economic changes such as deindustrialization. Gray’s analysis would suggest that the epidemic is partly the result of political choices that have marginalized large segments of the population, leaving them vulnerable to addiction as a form of escape from economic and social despair.\\n• Critique of Progress Narratives: Gray’s skepticism towards narratives of inevitable progress and improvement is relevant here. The opioid crisis challenges the idea that technological and economic advancements automatically lead to better lives for all. Instead, it reveals how progress can have uneven and often devastating impacts on different communities.\\n• The Role of Big Pharma: While Gray may not discuss this explicitly in the context of the opioid epidemic, his critique of corporate influence and the commodification of life under neoliberal capitalism is relevant. The aggressive marketing of opioids by pharmaceutical companies, driven by profit motives with insufficient regard for public health, exemplifies the ethical failures of a system that allows corporate interests to override societal well-being.\\n• Response to the Crisis: In line with Gray’s views on the limitations of current political and economic systems to address complex social issues, the opioid epidemic represents a challenge that requires more than just market-based solutions or individual interventions. It calls for a comprehensive societal response, including rethinking healthcare, social support systems, and the economic model that underpins American society.\\nOverall, while John Gray does not specifically focus on the opioid epidemic, his critiques of modern capitalism, neoliberal policies, and the neglect of social welfare provide a framework for understanding the crisis as part of broader societal failures.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",
              " 'MILLEY MARKER': ['\\n \\nCAPITOL HILL, THREE YEARS ON\\nCOUP IN WASHINGTON. In the days following the election, fears mounted that an unhinged Trump might bomb Iran. The Joint Chiefs Chairman alerted both his team and the Chinese: it wouldn’t happen.\\nby Luca Ciarrocca\\n“How do we secure the nuclear missiles?” This question, posed during a call between the highest-ranking military officer in America and the third in line for the presidential succession, encapsulated the dramatic hours following the January 6th, 2021 assault on Capitol Hill – the failed coup by Trump loyalists.\\nIt was General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President’s principal military advisor, who received the call from Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on January 8th. She was deeply alarmed by the chaos in Washington, with Congress besieged by thousands of agitators stirred up by Trump’s incendiary speech. Milley sought to reassure her that despite the insurrection, in terms of national security, there were “plenty of checks in the system.” Most importantly, in answer to her initial question, “the nuclear weapons are secure.”\\nThis was critical because the President – with his infamous ‘nuclear football’ – has the final say on deploying nuclear arms. And Trump, during those days, seemed deranged.\\nIn the final weeks of 2020, Milley became convinced that Trump, psychologically destabilized by his November 3rd electoral defeat, posed an imminent and real danger. The populist tycoon had lost by a wide margin (7 million fewer votes than Biden) yet continued to insist the elections were “rigged,” “stolen.” Trump, according to the general, “had undergone mental decline” following the vote, becoming “almost maniacal,” “screaming at senior advisors and staff members, desperately clinging to power, denying reality, and spreading lies,” Milley would later explain.\\nWhen the defeated President incited thousands of his fans to march on Capitol Hill on January 6th, resulting in violence, damage, five deaths, and the arrest of 570 people, the Joint Chiefs Chairman realized he couldn’t just stand by. After his call with Pelosi, he summoned a secret meeting in his Pentagon office with the top brass of the Armed Forces – the participants of the National Military Command Center, the Defense Ministry’s war room. The goal: to review the military engagement procedures with enemies, including the launch of nuclear missiles. He reiterated that only the President could give the order but – here’s the startling new development – he, Milley, had to be consulted for the final okay.\\nThe Chairman (appointed by Trump himself) instructed the Pentagon’s top echelons to not take orders from anyone – not even the President holed up in the Oval Office – unless he was involved. “No matter what you’re told, you follow the procedure. Follow the procedure. And I’m part of that procedure,” he ordered his subordinates. “And stay alert at all times.” Milley (now retired) then made two more calls. The first to National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone (“keep your antennas up… keep watching, scan every signal…”) and the second to CIA Director Gina Haspel: “Monitor everything very aggressively, 360 degrees.” The CIA chief confirmed the escalating tension scenario: “We’re heading towards a right-wing coup.” “The whole affair is madness. He’s behaving like a six-year-old throwing a tantrum.” Haspel feared Trump might try to attack Iran, to prove to the world he still held full powers and an aggressive international strategy.\\nThe urgency of the “available precautions” to prevent the defeated President from launching nuclear missiles was confirmed in a letter Pelosi sent to the Democratic caucus. “This morning, I spoke on the phone with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Mark Milley, to discuss the available precautions to prevent an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike,” the letter read. It arrived as Democrats were doing everything to remove Trump from office, pursuing two parallel paths: via an intervention by Vice President Mike Pence and some Cabinet members (two resigned, Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao), and with a Congressional impeachment request (which happened, but Trump was narrowly saved thanks to some GOP congress members).\\nThe tumultuous hours of the Pelosi-Milley call were scrutinized by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of the Washington Post, the former the author of the Watergate scoop that led to Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, the latter a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. In their book Peril, Woodward and Costa revealed further details on the geopolitical front. Milley, it’s reported in “Peril,” called his Chinese counterpart, at least twice: just before the November elections and shortly after the failed coup. The well-established direct relationship the U.S. supreme commander had woven with Li Zuocheng, General of the People’s Liberation Army of China and chief of the joint staff department of the Central Military Commission in Beijing, was providential. With Washington engulfed in instability, it was vital to avoid armed conflict between the two superpowers. Every “good faith precaution” was needed to ensure there was no historic breakdown of the international order, no accidental war with China or other countries, and no use of nuclear weapons,” Milley later explained to the Senate Defense Committee. To make himself understood, the American told the Chinese: “We have a plane with four engines, and three are out. We don’t have a landing gear. But we’re going to land this plane safely.”\\nIt sounds like geopolitical fantasy, but Milley believed that China, already alert due to Trump’s psychotic behavior, might militarily attack the United States if Xi Jinping felt threatened by an unpredictable, unstable, and vindictive White House. An “extraordinary risk.” So something unprecedented happened. The military leaders of the two rival superpowers found themselves united by a common mission: to prevent the outbreak of World War III.\\nThe first call took place on October 30th, 2020, four days before the presidential election, and the second on January 8th, 2021, two days after the assault on Capitol Hill. Milley had reviewed a top-secret report from the Pentagon’s intelligence services, which also weighed tensions over Taiwan, with U.S. Navy exercises in the South China Sea, exacerbated by Trump’s warmongering anti-China rhetoric. The sharp confrontation between the superpowers was intensified by the neo-McCarthyism against anything “Chinese”: from Beijing’s high-tech companies listed on Wall Street to popular apps like TikTok, not to mention COVID-19 labeled as the “Chinese virus.” “General Li, I want to reassure you, our government is stable and everything will be fine,” Milley explained to his counterpart. “We’re one hundred percent stable. Everything’s fine. Democracy can sometimes be messy (…) but we have no intention of conducting any military operations against you.” Milley even assured he would preemptively warn Li Zuocheng in the event of a missile launch. “You and I have known each other for five years now. If we’re forced to, I’ll call you in advance. It won’t be a surprise.”\\nToday the situation is, in many ways, worse. As the story of January 6th, 2021 confirms, pre-established protocols are crucial, but the rationality of leaders is of fundamental importance. Nonetheless, we’re all always in danger.\\nIl Fatto Quotidiano, January 6, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",
              " 'Vyvyan Holland': ['\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde’s works, provides an insightful overview of his father’s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family’s Dutch origin, Oscar’s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde’s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde’s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become ‘more Irish than the Irish’. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father’s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of ‘Speranza’, a name she had adopted from her motto ‘Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza’ – Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar’s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art’s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty’s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father’s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the ‘Apostle of Aestheticism’ and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife – Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n‘He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, ‘there was more rhyme than reason’; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called “the unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys”.’\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman’s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n‘I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk – Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc – all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all – the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising…Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.’\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: ‘Oscar Wilde.’\\nWilde’s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost’, The Sphinx without a Secret’ and ‘The Model Millionaire’. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father’s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father’s other book of short stories – one can hardly call them fairy tales – appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott’s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;’ In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty…When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, “What a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!” The artist agreed, adding, “How delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!” Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.’\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title ‘with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing’ shows the curious charm the word ‘importance’ had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere’s Fan, which he described as ‘one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades’. It was produced at the St James’s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of ‘Author!’ at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.’\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere’s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere’s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.’\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde’s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde’s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw’s comment on the play is worth repeating: ‘Mr Oscar Wilde’s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull…He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.’\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde’s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a ‘curtain raiser’, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde’s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James’s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: ‘This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.’ The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: ‘As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.’ A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father’s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood’s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father’s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas’s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",
              " 'MARY': ['\\n \\nNewport RFD 2\\nRhode Island\\n4/26/51\\nDear Hannah:\\nI’ve read your book [The Origins of Totalitarianism], absorbed, for the past two weeks, in the bathtub, riding in the car, waiting in line in the grocery store. It seems to me a truly extraordinary piece of work, an advance in human thought of, at the very least, a decade, and also engrossing and fascinating in the way that a novel is: i.e., that it says something on nearly every page that is novel, that one could not have anticipated from what went before but that one then recognizes as inevitable and foreshadowed by the underlying plot of ideas. I liked particularly the South African section—the highest point, to my mind, of the writing—the section on Disraeli, on the elite and vice and crime, on the modern nihilists, on the structure of the totalitarian movement, with the fellow-travelers representing “reality” to the members, the members to the cadres, and so on. My remarks on the style at lunch (which were largely second-hand) I utterly withdraw, there are a few barbarisms, such as the use of “ignore” to mean “be ignorant of” that are of no consequence but might be corrected in another edition. I would make one larger criticism: the implication you make, through the sheer exuberance of explaining its functioning, that totalitarianism is a scheme in the minds of certain displaced men to rob other men of their sense of reality seems to me to scant the element of the fortuitous in the development of this whole phenomenon, that is, the fact that certain features have been incorporated into these movements, without anyone’s cleverness, simply because they worked. In other words, you sometimes suggest that [there] are laws of political conduct, comparable to the laws governing aesthetic matters, that the Nazis and Stalin have special access to, that they have understood and interpreted the meaning of their epoch as a great maître would have done, i.e., that something existed prior to them, of which they are the Platonic shadows or eidolons. This may very well be true, it certainly is often the impression one gets, and yet it is not demonstrably true here, in the text, for at other times you appear to take an opposite view, that is, that man is not interpreter or artiste to a rational universe, but a creator without a model to draw from.\\nI don’t think I express this very well, and I haven’t the book to consult, having already lent it, but perhaps you will see what I mean. It is why the Concluding Remarks follow a little oddly on the text, and why, I think, you lean perhaps a little too heavily on paradox (a formalist truth) in the opening chapters where factual evidence is slight or balky. But all this is of very minor import and perhaps results from an amateur’s innocence (I mean mine, not yours). I thought David Riesman’s strictures and pious exceptions terribly stupid, it seemed to me that he understood the book and the marvel of its construction very little (“How did the treatment of the natives by the Boers influence Hitler?” or words to that effect).1 Other great admirers of the book are the Schlesingers [Arthur and Marian],2 who are very eager to meet you. Could you and Heinrich [Blücher, Arendt’s husband] come up to stay with us for the weekend after this one or any weekend in May? They would like to come down and have lunch and talk to you whenever you can come.\\nBowden [Broadwater, McCarthy’s third husband] sends greetings to you both. And many thanks to you as an author. I must say, as a fellow one, I stand in awe, among other things, of your energy. What a tremendous job that must have been!\\nYours,\\nMary\\nP. S.

Much more to say on this point, on the anti-semitism [sic] of modern prophetic types, Lawrence, Pound, Dostoeivsky [sic]. Will save it for your visit.\\nNOTES\\n1. David Riesman’s “strictures” must have been delivered in conversation or in a panel discussion, for there is no record of his having reviewed Arendt’s book\\n2.

              " 'HENRY': ['\\n \\nHenry David Thoreau was born in 1817 and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, living there for most of his life. Along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in America and is still widely read today. Walden (1854), the work for which he is best known, is drawn from the journal he kept during his two-year-long stay in a cabin on Walden Pond. In Walden, Thoreau explores his interests in naturalism, individualism, and self-sufficiency. He is also remembered for his essay “Civil Disobedience” (1849), an early, influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., many in the civil rights movement.\\n“Where I Lived, and What I Lived For” is taken from Walden. In it, Thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods. Writing about Walden, scholars have pointed out that Thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with, among other things, pies. As you read, consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to say.\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a comer, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made of up petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the lands; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stem and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get our sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over, so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again.\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven’t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus’ dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would foresake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it bum, since bum it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire—or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half-hour’s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, “What’s the news?” as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night’s sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. “Pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe”—and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.\\n“When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.”\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life — I wrote this some years ago — that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed bv accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter—we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure—news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth, or twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions — they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers — and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers; and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old! “Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy messenger!” The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week—for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one—with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, “Pause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?”\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that “there was a kings son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his fathers ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,” continues the Hindoo philosopher, “from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be Brahme.” I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the “Milldam” go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at the meetinghouse, or a courthouse, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or breakfast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry—determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is downhill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like. Let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through Church and State, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a point d’appui, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamppost safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business.\\nTime is but the stream I go afishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so bv the divining-rod and thin rising vapors, I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

One such memorable moment occurred during a lunch with his Playboy editor in 1972. Tasked with the daunting prospect of participating in an orgy for a humorous essay, Greenburg’s characteristic shyness came to the forefront. This real-life awkwardness and vulnerability made his writing all the more relatable and endearing.\\nHis personal life, particularly his first marriage to journalist Nora Ephron, influenced his work significantly.

His divorce from Ephron and the legal battles that ensued marked one of his life’s toughest periods. However, these experiences only added depth to his work, making him a beloved figure in satirical literature. His resilience and ability to transform personal adversity into humor and art are part of what made his work so impactful and enduring.\\nDan Greenburg’s legacy lives on through his writing, which continues to entertain and provoke thought in readers of all ages.

With a career that spanned several decades, Greenburg was celebrated for his sharp wit and satirical writing, which shone brightly across a diverse body of work, including books, essays, screenplays, and more. He made a significant mark in literature and entertainment, poking fun at a wide range of subjects with a unique blend of humor and insight.\\nHis most notable work, \\u201cHow to Be a Jewish Mother,\\u201d humorously dissected the stereotypical Jewish mother, offering advice with a tongue-in-cheek tone that captivated readers nationwide. The book became a cultural touchstone, reflecting Greenburg\\u2019s ability to observe and satirize the nuances of everyday life. Despite its specific cultural references, the book\\u2019s underlying themes of familial love and the complexities of identity resonated with a broad audience, making it a bestseller.\\nBorn in Chicago, Greenburg\\u2019s career spanned various genres, from horror and the occult to murder mysteries and children\\u2019s literature, reflecting his versatile talent and boundless creativity. His series, \\u201cThe Zack Files,\\u201d inspired by his son, Zack O\\u2019Malley Greenburg, brought laughter and adventure to young readers globally, showcasing his ability to engage and entertain audiences of all ages.\\nGreenburg\\u2019s life was filled with intriguing episodes and encounters that often found their way into his work. One such memorable moment occurred during a lunch with his Playboy editor in 1972. Tasked with the daunting prospect of participating in an orgy for a humorous essay, Greenburg\\u2019s characteristic shyness came to the forefront. This real-life awkwardness and vulnerability made his writing all the more relatable and endearing.\\nHis personal life, particularly his first marriage to journalist Nora Ephron, influenced his work significantly. Their relationship and subsequent amicable divorce provided fodder for his writing, illustrating his ability to infuse personal experiences with humor and poignancy. Greenburg\\u2019s subsequent marriages and life experiences continued to shape his perspective and work, adding layers of depth and authenticity.\\nThroughout his career, Greenburg tackled a wide array of subjects, from the paranormal to neurotic sexual fantasies, earning praise and respect for his insightful yet humorous take on various themes. His examination of the paranormal in \\u201cSomething\\u2019s There\\u201d was lauded for its skeptical and street-smart perspective. Critics and fans alike appreciated his enduring sense of humor, even as he ventured into exploring more complex and darker topics.\\nDespite achieving fame and success, Greenburg\\u2019s journey wasn\\u2019t without its challenges. His divorce from Ephron and the legal battles that ensued marked one of his life\\u2019s toughest periods. However, these experiences only added depth to his work, making him a beloved figure in satirical literature. His resilience and ability to transform personal adversity into humor and art are part of what made his work so impactful and enduring.\\nDan Greenburg\\u2019s legacy lives on through his writing, which continues to entertain and provoke thought in readers of all ages. His ability to find humor in life\\u2019s complexities made him a unique voice in literature and a cherished storyteller whose work will be enjoyed for generations to come. As we reflect on his life and contributions, we are reminded of the power of humor to connect, heal, and reveal the truths of the human experience. Greenburg\\u2019s pen might have been laid to rest, but the laughter and insights it provoked will continue to resonate, making our world a bit brighter and more bearable.\\nDaniel Greenburg\\u00a0(June 20, 1936 \\u2013 December 18, 2023)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nHenry David Thoreau was born in 1817 and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, living there for most of his life. Along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in America and is still widely read today. Walden (1854), the work for which he is best known, is drawn from the journal he kept during his two-year-long stay in a cabin on Walden Pond. In Walden, Thoreau explores his interests in naturalism, individualism, and self-sufficiency. He is also remembered for his essay \\u201cCivil Disobedience\\u201d (1849), an early, influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., many in the civil rights movement.\\n\\u201cWhere I Lived, and What I Lived For\\u201d is taken from Walden. In it, Thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods. Writing about Walden, scholars have pointed out that Thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with, among other things, pies. As you read, consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to say.\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a comer, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to \\u201cglorify God and enjoy him forever.\\u201d\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made of up petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the lands; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stem and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get our sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over, so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again.\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven\\u2019t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus\\u2019 dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would foresake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it bum, since bum it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half-hour\\u2019s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the news?\\u201d as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night\\u2019s sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. \\u201cPray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe\\u201d\\u2014and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.\\n\\u201cWhen we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.\\u201d\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life \\u2014 I wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed bv accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth, or twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers; and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old! \\u201cKieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy messenger!\\u201d The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week\\u2014for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one\\u2014with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, \\u201cPause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?\\u201d\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights\\u2019 Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that \\u201cthere was a kings son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his fathers ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,\\u201d continues the Hindoo philosopher, \\u201cfrom the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be Brahme.\\u201d I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the \\u201cMilldam\\u201d go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at the meetinghouse, or a courthouse, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or breakfast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry\\u2014determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is downhill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like. Let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through Church and State, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a point d\\u2019appui, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamppost safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business.\\nTime is but the stream I go afishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so bv the divining-rod and thin rising vapors, I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'\\n \\nIn his book, ‘Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism’, Yanis Varoufakis explores how giant tech firms, both in the US and China are expanding their control over the planet. His analysis is that, whilst material resources certainly matter, the real battle ground is over digital real estate.\\nVaroufakis, a renowned economist and political thinker, presents a future where the digital age has not ushered in the equitable, socialist utopia many had hoped for but has instead birthed a new form of inequality and economic disparity reminiscent of feudal times, yet distinctly marked by digital characteristics.\\nThe foundation of Varoufakis’s argument rests on the observation that the digital giants—companies like Google, Uber, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon—have amassed unprecedented power and wealth, not merely through traditional capitalist means but by establishing monopolies over digital platforms and resources. These companies, according to Varoufakis, are the new lords of a techno-feudal system, where the “cloud” serves as their domain from which they extract rent, much like feudal lords extracted rent from land.\\nThis techno-feudalism is characterized by the concentration of capital and power in the hands of a few, a phenomenon that, while not entirely new, has reached new heights in the digital age. The traditional capitalist notion of competition and market dynamics has given way to a system where access to digital platforms is controlled by these giants, effectively stifling competition and innovation from smaller entities. Europe’s lag in developing its own digital giants exacerbates this issue, making it dependent on American and Chinese tech monopolies.\\nVaroufakis further argues that this concentration of power and capital has significant implications for taxation and the distribution of wealth. Amazon’s operations in Europe, where it generates billions in revenue while paying minimal taxes, exemplify the skewed financial benefits that favor these digital overlords. This, he posits, is not merely a failure of capitalism but a transformation into something more sinister that mirrors feudalism, where societal wealth is siphoned to the top, leaving the masses with fewer economic opportunities and benefits.\\nThe shift to techno-feudalism, as Varoufakis describes, is also marked by a mutation within capitalism itself. Capitalism, in its quest for growth and dominance, has birthed a form of capital—cloud capital—that has ultimately turned on its creator. This cloud capital, controlled by the tech giants, has the power to extract rents and surpluses from both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, redefining the economic landscape and power dynamics.\\nVaroufakis’s insights into the role of digital currencies and payment systems further highlight the transformation underway. The development of digital currencies by China, contrasted with Europe’s lack of similar innovation, underscores the shifting balance of economic power and the emergence of new centers of economic control and influence.\\nIn discussing the geopolitical implications of this shift, Varoufakis points to the rising tensions between the United States and China. The competition is not merely economic but also technological, with both nations vying for dominance in the digital realm. This rivalry, he fears, could lead to conflict, emphasizing the importance of understanding techno-feudalism not just as an economic phenomenon but as a factor reshaping global politics and power structures.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis critiques the liberal notion of the individual, arguing that the pervasive influence of big tech on our lives has eroded the autonomy and privacy that are central to liberal democracy. The data collected by these tech giants on individuals’ preferences, behaviors, and interactions not only fuels their economic dominance but also challenges the very notion of individual freedom and autonomy.\\nIn conclusion, Varoufakis’s discussion of techno-feudalism presents a compelling and concerning vision of the future, where the digital revolution has not liberated humanity but has instead entrenched new forms of inequality and control. The rise of digital giants as the new feudal lords of the 21st century, wielding power over digital realms and extracting economic rents from society, signals a profound shift in the economic and social order. This transition challenges us to rethink our understanding of capitalism, democracy, and freedom in the digital age, urging a reevaluation of the systems and structures that govern our lives.\\n\\n* * *\\nHow big tech has enslaved us according to Yanis Varoufakis?\\nYanis Varoufakis articulates a compelling argument on how big tech has, in essence, enslaved contemporary society, drawing on the concept of techno-feudalism to describe this phenomenon. According to Varoufakis, the evolution of capitalism into this new phase is characterized by several key dynamics:\\n1. Monopolization of the Digital Space: Big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook (now Meta), and Apple have established dominant positions in the digital economy, effectively monopolizing vast swathes of the internet. This dominance allows them to control access to markets, information, and communication platforms, exerting unprecedented power over both consumers and producers.\\n2. Extraction of Digital Rents: Varoufakis argues that these tech giants extract enormous rents from the economy without the traditional exchange of goods and services. By controlling the digital infrastructure — the “cloud” — these companies can impose fees and conditions that extract wealth from both individuals and businesses, funneling profits to an elite few while contributing minimally to public coffers through tax avoidance strategies.\\n3. Surveillance and Data Exploitation: The enslavement also extends to the pervasive surveillance and data mining practices of big tech companies. By harvesting vast amounts of personal data, these entities not only invade privacy but also manipulate consumer behavior and preferences, locking individuals into a cycle of consumption and influence that diminishes autonomy and personal freedom.\\n4. Erosion of Liberal Individualism: Varoufakis highlights how the techno-feudal system undermines the concept of the liberal individual — a cornerstone of democratic society. The constant monitoring and data collection by big tech companies compromise the autonomy and self-determination of individuals, reshaping identities and behaviors through algorithmic manipulation.\\n5. Perpetuation of Inequality: The techno-feudal model exacerbates inequality by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the tech oligarchs while the majority of society sees diminishing economic prospects and eroding rights. This concentration of power mirrors feudal structures, where lords wielded control over land and serfs, but in the modern context, it’s digital territory and data.\\n6. Dependency and Powerlessness: Society’s increasing dependency on digital platforms for economic, social, and political engagement has rendered individuals and smaller entities powerless against the might of big tech. This dependency is likened to feudal vassalage, where serfs had no choice but to submit to the lords’ authority.\\n7. Geopolitical Implications: Varoufakis also delves into the geopolitical ramifications of big tech’s rise, particularly the tension between the U.S. and China, as both nations vie for technological and economic supremacy. This rivalry underscores the global impact of techno-feudalism, with Europe lagging behind and losing relevance in the new digital order.\\nIn summary, Yanis Varoufakis paints a stark picture of a society ensnared by the technological and economic might of big tech companies. This enslavement, according to his analysis, is not just a matter of economic dominance but extends to the very fabric of individual freedom, societal structure, and global power dynamics, signaling a profound shift from traditional capitalist models to a new era of techno-feudalism.\\n* * *\\nJeff Bezos and Amazon\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Jeff Bezos within the broader narrative of techno-feudalism, highlighting how Bezos, through Amazon, exemplifies the shift from traditional capitalist practices to a new era where digital platforms and cloud capital dominate. Bezos is portrayed as a modern feudal lord of the digital age, where his control over Amazon’s vast online marketplace and cloud services positions him at the forefront of this economic transformation.\\nVaroufakis points out that Amazon, under Bezos’s leadership, has become more than just an online retailer; it is a massive platform that controls significant portions of the digital economy, from e-commerce to cloud computing services. This control allows Amazon to extract rents from other businesses that rely on its platform to reach consumers, a practice reminiscent of feudal lords extracting rent from their lands. The comparison to feudalism is used to illustrate the power dynamics in the digital economy, where platform owners like Bezos wield immense power over the market, shaping economic activities and influencing the distribution of wealth.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis criticizes the tax practices associated with companies like Amazon. He highlights how Amazon generates billions in revenue, particularly in Europe, without contributing a proportionate amount in taxes. This situation exacerbates economic inequalities and underscores the challenges that digital economies pose to traditional frameworks of taxation and regulation.\\nThe discussion around Bezos and Amazon serves to underline the broader themes of techno-feudalism that Varoufakis explores. It reflects concerns about the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few digital platform owners, the erosion of traditional market dynamics, and the societal implications of these shifts, including impacts on privacy, labor, and democracy. Through the example of Bezos, Varoufakis calls attention to the urgent need to address these challenges and rethink the governance of digital economies to ensure a more equitable and democratic future.\\n\\n\\n\\n* * *\\nElon Musk\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Elon Musk within the context of the broader shift towards techno-feudalism, highlighting Musk’s ambitions and the strategic moves he has made in the tech world as emblematic of the new forms of power and control emerging in the digital age. Musk, known for his ventures such as Tesla and his interest in acquiring Twitter, serves as a case study for Varoufakis’s arguments about cloud capital and its impact on society.\\nVaroufakis points out that Elon Musk’s ventures, particularly Tesla, are not just about manufacturing electric vehicles but are deeply integrated with digital technologies and cloud capital. Tesla cars, connected to the cloud, collect vast amounts of data on their users’ behaviors, preferences, and movements. This data collection extends beyond the automotive industry, touching on aspects of digital surveillance and data monetization that are central to techno-feudalism. Musk’s desire to replicate a platform like WeChat, which combines social media, messaging, payments, and other services into a single ecosystem, is highlighted as an attempt to further integrate and control various aspects of digital and physical life.\\nThe discussion around Musk and his interest in platforms like Twitter underscores a broader trend where tech entrepreneurs are not just content creators or service providers but are becoming the new lords of the digital realm. They wield significant power over the digital landscapes they control, much like feudal lords once controlled their lands and the people within them. This comparison is used to illustrate the transformation of capital in the digital age, where ownership of digital platforms and the data they generate becomes a source of unprecedented power and wealth.\\nVaroufakis’s insights into Musk’s activities reflect concerns over the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants and entrepreneurs. This concentration is seen as a fundamental feature of techno-feudalism, where digital platforms become new fiefs, and their owners, the new feudal lords, exert significant influence over the economy, society, and even the political landscape. Musk’s ventures exemplify how technology and capital are merging to create new forms of economic and social organization, challenging traditional notions of capitalism and prompting a reevaluation of our future in a digitally dominated world.\\n* * *\\nTesla\\nYanis Varoufakis discusses Tesla within the context of the transition from traditional capitalism to what he terms “techno-feudalism,” emphasizing the role of companies like Tesla in this new economic landscape. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, is not just an automaker but a tech company that exemplifies the fusion of technology with traditional manufacturing, reshaping economic relationships and production methods. Here’s how Varoufakis frames Tesla in his analysis:\\nTesla as a Cloud Company\\nVaroufakis highlights that Tesla’s value and innovation extend beyond the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Tesla is deeply integrated into the cloud, leveraging data collection, connectivity, and software to enhance its vehicles and customer experience. This integration allows Tesla to continuously update and improve its vehicles after purchase, a stark contrast to traditional automakers whose products remain static post-sale.\\nData and Value Extraction\\nTesla’s vehicles are equipped with a range of sensors and connectivity features that collect vast amounts of data on driving habits, preferences, and vehicle performance. This data is not just used to refine Tesla’s products but also represents a form of cloud capital. According to Varoufakis, this positions Tesla similarly to big tech firms that extract value through data, distinguishing it from conventional car manufacturers. Tesla’s business model, therefore, embodies the techno-feudalism thesis, where value is increasingly derived from digital and data-driven domains rather than solely physical goods.\\nThe Cloud as Capital\\nVaroufakis uses Tesla as an example to illustrate his broader point that the cloud has become a form of capital in itself. In this new economy, companies like Tesla that can harness cloud-based data and platforms possess a significant competitive advantage. They are not just selling products but are also engaging in the extraction of data-driven value, a characteristic feature of techno-feudalism.\\nImpact on Traditional Industry\\nTesla’s rise and its approach to vehicle production and data utilization signify a shift in how value is created and captured in the economy. This shift challenges traditional industrial companies, which are more reliant on physical production and less integrated with digital technologies. Varoufakis suggests that companies unable to adapt to this cloud-based model may find themselves at a disadvantage, further accelerating the divide between traditional capitalism and the emerging techno-feudal system.\\nTesla and the Future of Work\\nThe discussion around Tesla also touches on broader implications for the future of work and the economy. As companies leverage cloud capital and data, the nature of work, value creation, and economic power structures are transformed. This raises questions about labor rights, data privacy, and the distribution of economic benefits in a world where a few tech giants could dominate much of the economic landscape.\\nVaroufakis’s mention of Tesla serves to exemplify the broader economic transformation towards techno-feudalism, where the integration of technology, data, and cloud platforms redefines value creation and economic power. Tesla, in this analysis, is not merely an automotive company but a symbol of the shift towards a new economic order dominated by digital technologies and data-driven business models.\\n* * *\\nFree Payments (WeChat Pay and Alipay)\\nIn the discussion, Yanis Varoufakis touches upon the concept of “free payments” in the context of digital platforms and technologies, particularly referencing China’s advancements in this area. This concept is part of his broader analysis of techno-feudalism and how certain technological innovations are reshaping economic and social relations.\\nThe Concept of Free Payments\\nFree payments refer to the ability to conduct financial transactions without incurring traditional banking fees, facilitated by digital platforms that bypass conventional financial institutions. This innovation is significant in the context of big tech’s encroachment into the financial sector, offering a glimpse into how these companies are leveraging technology to create alternative financial ecosystems that challenge the status quo.\\nCase Study: China’s Digital Currency and Payment Systems\\nVaroufakis highlights China’s development of digital currency and payment platforms, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, as prime examples of the free payments phenomenon. These platforms allow users to make transactions directly from their smartphones, seamlessly integrating payment capabilities into a broader digital ecosystem that includes social media, e-commerce, and more. The critical innovation here is the elimination of transaction fees typically charged by banks, thereby democratizing access to digital financial services and enhancing the efficiency of economic transactions.\\nImplications of Free Payments\\n1. Disruption of Traditional Banking: The rise of free payment platforms challenges the business model of traditional banks, which rely on transaction fees as a significant revenue source. This shift could lead to a reconfiguration of the banking industry, pushing it toward more innovative and user-friendly services.\\n2. Centralization of Power: While free payments democratize access to financial services, they also concentrate power in the hands of platform operators, like big tech firms, who control the digital infrastructure facilitating these transactions. This centralization raises concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential for abuse of market dominance.\\n3. Economic and Social Transformation: The widespread adoption of free payment technologies can transform economies, particularly in developing countries where traditional banking services are limited. By enabling more efficient and inclusive financial transactions, these technologies can spur economic growth and social development.\\n4. Regulatory Challenges: The emergence of free payment systems poses significant regulatory challenges, as governments and financial authorities grapple with issues of privacy, cybersecurity, financial stability, and competition. The global nature of big tech companies further complicates regulatory efforts, requiring international cooperation to address these challenges effectively.\\n5. Strategic Geopolitical Considerations: Varoufakis also points out the geopolitical dimensions of free payment systems, particularly in the context of U.S.-China rivalry. The development of digital currencies and payment platforms is part of a broader contest for technological supremacy, with implications for global economic leadership and strategic influence.\\nYanis Varoufakis’s discussion of free payments within the framework of techno-feudalism underscores the transformative potential of digital financial technologies. While these innovations offer opportunities for economic empowerment and efficiency, they also raise critical questions about privacy, power concentration, and the future of financial systems in a digitally dominated world. The evolution of free payment systems exemplifies the broader shifts in economic and social relations that Varoufakis associates with the transition to a new era of techno-feudalism.\\n* * *\\nBill Clinton\\nYanis Varoufakis mentions Bill Clinton in the context of discussing the evolution of capitalism and the regulatory changes that occurred during Clinton’s presidency, which had significant implications for the financial sector and broader economic landscape. Clinton’s tenure in the 1990s is notable for several policies that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the deregulation of financial markets, aspects that Varoufakis critiques in his analysis of the shift towards techno-feudalism.\\nKey Points Related to Clinton’s Policies:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Deregulation of the Financial Sector: One of the hallmark policies of the Clinton administration was the deregulation of the financial industry. This included the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act through the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which removed the separation between commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance services. This deregulation is often cited as a factor that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the increased risk-taking behavior of financial institutions, leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.\\n2. Promotion of Financialization: The Clinton administration’s policies are seen as facilitating the financialization of the American economy, a process by which financial services became a more dominant sector, influencing economic policy and corporate strategies. This shift towards financialization is characterized by an increased role of financial markets, institutions, and motives in the economy, contributing to the phenomena that Varoufakis identifies as part of the movement towards techno-feudalism.\\n3. Global Economic Policies: Clinton’s tenure also saw the promotion of globalization and free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While intended to boost economic growth through increased trade, these policies also had wide-ranging effects on labor markets and the distribution of economic power, themes that are central to Varoufakis’s critique of the current economic order.\\n4. Impact on Inequality: Varoufakis and other critics argue that the economic policies of the Clinton era, particularly those related to deregulation and financialization, have contributed to rising inequality. They assert that these policies benefited financial elites and the tech oligarchs at the expense of the broader population, exacerbating economic disparities.\\nIn mentioning Clinton, Varoufakis underscores the significance of political and regulatory decisions in shaping the economic landscape, leading to the conditions that he describes as techno-feudalism. Clinton’s presidency is cited as a pivotal period when policies that favored deregulation and financialization were implemented, setting the stage for the economic challenges and transformations that Varoufakis explores in his work.\\n* * *\\nSurveillance and privacy\\nYanis Varoufakis paints a concerning picture of how digital platforms and cloud capital have fundamentally altered the nature of individual autonomy and privacy. He argues that the rise of big tech companies and their control over digital infrastructure have led to an unprecedented level of surveillance, far surpassing anything imagined in traditional or even dystopian views of state surveillance.\\nHe highlights how these companies collect vast amounts of data on individuals’ behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This data collection is not incidental but central to the business models of these platforms, which rely on harvesting personal information to generate profits through targeted advertising, selling data to third parties, or refining their services to increase user engagement and dependence.\\nThe economist critically examines the relationship between individuals and digital platforms, especially how platforms like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s search engine are designed to learn from users, only to use that information to influence and modify their behavior in return. This cycle of data collection and behavioral influence challenges the liberal notion of the autonomous individual, suggesting that our choices and preferences are increasingly shaped by algorithms and corporate interests rather than genuine personal freedom.\\nVaroufakis’s analysis extends to the societal implications of this surveillance economy, questioning the viability of privacy in a world where personal data is the primary currency. He suggests that the very concept of the liberal individual—a cornerstone of democratic societies—is under threat in an era where people’s thoughts, movements, and desires are constantly monitored and commodified by tech giants.\\nMoreover, he touches on the psychological impact of living under constant surveillance, where individuals must curate their online presence with the awareness that future employers, governments, or malicious actors might scrutinize their digital footprints. This reality erodes the distinction between public and private life, forcing individuals to self-censor or alter their behavior not just in digital spaces but in all aspects of life, due to the omnipresence of digital surveillance.\\nIn essence, Varoufakis warns that techno-feudalism, with its foundation in cloud capital and digital platforms, has ushered in an era where surveillance and the erosion of privacy are not just byproducts but essential mechanisms of power and control. This shift has profound implications for democracy, freedom, and human dignity, challenging us to reconsider the values and structures that underpin our societies in the digital age.\\n* * *\\nEurope\\nYanis Varoufakis expresses a stark and sobering view on Europe’s position in the emerging global order dominated by techno-feudalism. He believes that Europe has become increasingly irrelevant on the world stage, particularly in the face of rising powers like China and the United States, which have developed significant technological and economic dominance through their control of cloud capital and digital platforms. Europe’s lack of comparable digital giants leaves it at a significant disadvantage, making it dependent on American and Chinese tech monopolies for digital infrastructure and services.\\nVaroufakis points out that Europe does not have its own equivalents to Google, Facebook, Uber, Apple, or Amazon. This absence means that European companies and economies are forced to operate within the digital and economic ecosystems controlled by these foreign giants, effectively rendering Europe a vassal to their techno-feudal empires. This dependency is not just an economic concern but also a geopolitical weakness, as Europe lacks the technological sovereignty to assert itself in the digital age.\\nThe conversation highlights the significant tax contributions—or the lack thereof—made by tech giants in Europe. Amazon’s operations serve as a prime example, with the company making billions in revenue within Europe while paying minimal taxes. This situation underscores the economic disparities that techno-feudalism exacerbates, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few non-European entities, while European states and citizens are left with diminishing returns and influence.\\nFurthermore, Varoufakis discusses the geopolitical implications of Europe’s diminished role, particularly in the context of rising tensions between the United States and China. He suggests that Europe’s political and economic fragmentation, combined with its technological lag, renders it a secondary player in global affairs. The continent’s inability to present a unified or powerful front in international negotiations or conflicts, such as the situation in Ukraine, exemplifies its declining influence.\\nVaroufakis’s perspective on Europe is not just an economic critique but also a call to recognize the profound transformations underway in the global order. He argues that Europe’s future is at risk unless it can navigate the challenges of techno-feudalism, reclaim technological sovereignty, and redefine its role in a world where digital platforms and cloud capital are reshaping economies, societies, and geopolitics.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'"

affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumbnail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousandandone items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify instead of three meals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundred dishes five and reduce other things in proportion our life is like a german confederacy made of up petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment the nation itself with all its socalled internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the lands and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stem and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose it lives too fast men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain if we do not get our sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad each one is a man an irishman or a yankee man the rails are laid on them and they are covered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them they are sound sleepers i assure you and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again\\nwhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life we are determined to be starved before we are hungry men say that a stitch in time saves nine and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow as for work we haven\\u2019t any of any consequence we have the saint vitus\\u2019 dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still if i should only give a few pulls at the parish bellrope as for a fire that is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor a woman i might almost say but would foresake all and follow that sound not mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confess the truth much more to see it bum since bum it must and we be it known did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out and have a hand in it if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parish church itself hardly a man takes a halfhour\\u2019s nap after dinner but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks \\u201cwhat\\u2019s the news\\u201d as if the rest of mankind had

wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage the pennypost is commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper if we read of one man robbed or murdered or killed bv accident or one house burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or one cow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another one is enough if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care for a myriad instances and applications to a philosopher all news as it is called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea yet not a few are greedy after this gossip there was such a rush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since i saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of  and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character if one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a french revolution not excepted\\nwhat news how much more important to know what that is which was never old \\u201ckieouheyu great dignitary of the state of wei sent a man to

reality is fabulous if men would steadily observe realities only and not allow themselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as we know would be like a fairy tale and the arabian

and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality this is always exhilarating and sublime by closing the eyes and slumbering and consenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built on purely illusory foundations children who play life discern its true law and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthily but who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure i have read in a hindoo book that \\u201cthere was a kings son who being expelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a forester and growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived one of his fathers ministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and the misconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be a prince so soul\\u201d continues the

his description look at the meetinghouse or a courthouse or a jail or a shop or a dwellinghouse and say what that thing really is before a true gaze and they would all go to pieces in your account of them men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behind the farthest star before adam and after the last man in eternity there is indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now and here god himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us the universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us let us spend our lives in conceiving then the poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it\\nlet us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails let us rise early and fast or breakfast gently and without perturbation let company

it looking another way tied to the mast like ulysses if the engine whistles let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains if the bell rings why should we run we will consider what kind of music they are like let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance that alluvion which covers the globe through paris and london through new york and boston and concord through church and state through poetry and philosophy and religion till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality and say this is and no mistake and then begin having a point d\\u2019appui below freshet and frost and fire a place where you might found a wall or a state or set a lamppost safely or perhaps a gauge not a nilometer but a realometer that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time if you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces as if it were a cimeter and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow and so you will happily conclude your mortal career be it

life including his trial imprisonment and posthumous conversion to catholicism ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history\\n  \\nintroduction to the  edition\\nby vyvyan holland\\noscar wilde\\u2019s family is dutch in origin the first wilde to settle in ireland was a certain colonel de wilde the son of an artist examples of whose work hang in the art gallery at the hague he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to king william iii of england he is said to have repented his adherence to the english king and to have become \\u2018more irish than the irish\\u2019 from that time the family were land agents and doctors\\nmy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way sir william wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time and a physician of international repute he invented the operation for cataract and performed it on king oscar of sweden for which he received the order of the polar star his mother lady wilde born jane francesca elgee was a staunch irish nationalist who wrote fierce poems and articles in the irish nationalist newspaper the nation under the name of \\u2018speranza\\u2019 a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018fidanza constanza speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 faith constancy hope lady wilde had three children william oscar and isola who died when she was ten to oscar\\u2019s lasting grief oscar wilde was born on  october  and was given the names oscar fingal o\\u2019flahertie wills wilde\\nhis education began at portora royal school in enniskillen from which he obtained a scholarship to trinity college dublin where he won the berkeley gold medal for greek from there he received a demyship to magdalen college oxford while at oxford he came under the influence of john ruskin and walter pater pater preached the love of art for art\\u2019s sake and oscar wilde going one step further set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by rossetti and burnejones aestheticism was the keynote of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive\\nmy father\\u2019s life at oxford one gathers from his letters was a joyous one he entered wholeheartedly into the undergraduate life of the university and distinguished himself by winning the newdigate prize for english verse and getting a double first in classics upon this note he came to london in  with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen true to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018apostle of aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress it must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the british upper middle classes was rigidly conventional and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid kneebreeches black silk stockings a soft loose shirt with a wide turndown collar and a large flowing tie was bound to arouse indignant curiosity\\nat the same time he was writing poems and in  he also wrote vera a rather immature play which ran for one week in new york in  and never reached the boards in london in  his collected poems were published and in  being short of money he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to america this proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to england in  covered if not with glory at least with considerable notoriety\\non his return to europe he retired to paris to finish another play the duchess of padua for the american actress mary anderson but when she received the play she turned it down flatly this was really a disaster for oscar wilde and he returned to england and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces however this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to london where in  he married constance mary daughter of a distinguished irish barrister horace lloyd qc oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy he had two sons by his wife \\u2013 cyril born in  and myself in \\noddly enough although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage he now turned largely to prose and with the exception of the sphinx the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment when he wrote the ballad of reading gaol boris brasol who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father sums up his poetic period as follows\\n\\u2018he began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which however as he himself admitted \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019 yet as he grew older he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry and though there is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d\\u2019\\nupon what then does his reputation as an author rest his early poems were mostly lyrical and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time his true literary life was spread over seven years only from  until  in  he had become editor of woman\\u2019s world in which capacity he continued until  when he resigned he had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and still more as a conversationalist there are few people alive now who remember his conversation but when in  a plaque was unveiled by sir compton mackenzie on the house in tite street where my family lived for eleven years he read the following message from sir max beerbohm the incomparable max who felt too frail to undertake the journey to london to be present\\n\\u2018i have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 meredith and swinburne edmund gosse and henry james augustine birrell and arthur balfour gilbert chesterton and desmond maccarthy and hilaire belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way but oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso to have heard him consoled me for not having heard dr johnson or edmund burke lord brougham or sidney smith\\u2019\\nwinston churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life and he replied without hesitation \\u2018oscar wilde\\u2019\\nwilde\\u2019s first memorable work was the happy prince which appeared in  the stories in the happy prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults\\nin  he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously the book was called lord arthur savile\\u2019s crime and other stories the other three tales being the canterville ghost\\u2019 the sphinx without a secret\\u2019 and \\u2018the model millionaire\\u2019 the first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions they possess the lighthearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in the importance of being earnest and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time\\na house of pomegranates my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by charles shannon ra in the same year this book completely puzzled the critics who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested quite rightly that no child could understand them this was followed by the sphinx which really dated from his oxford days and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since the critics were again confused by the poem which was really nothing more than an experiment with words he revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque which he rhymed with hippogriff and amenalk\\nin  too oscar wilde\\u2019s only novel the picture of dorian gray appeared in book form enlarged from the original which had been already published in lippincott\\u2019s magazine the publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics the english press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book the idea of the book had first come to my father some years before hesketh pearson tells the story of it in his life of oscar wilde\\u2019 in the year  wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter basil ward one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026when the portrait was done and the youth had gone wilde happened to say \\u201cwhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old\\u201d the artist agreed adding \\u201chow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is while the portrait aged and withered in his stead\\u201d wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story basil hallward\\u2019\\nby far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that oscar wilde wrote was intentions in which he really gave rein to his imagination in my own opinion it is the most absorbing of all his works the critic as artist occupies considerably more than half of it its subtitle \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him it occurs in the titles of two of his plays and is constantly cropping up in his essays it is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it if not round his tongue then round his mind\\nbut the most interesting essay in the book is the decay of lying the essay is in the form of a dialogue the dominant theme being the vast superiority of art over nature leading to the conclusion that nature follows art\\noscar wilde now entered into his final stage the one for which he was destined that of a dramatist in  he wrote lady windermere\\u2019s fan which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawingroom plays with pink lampshades\\u2019 it was produced at the st james\\u2019s theatre in february  by george alexander there were loud cries of \\u2018author\\u2019 at the end of the play and wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said \\u2018ladies and gentlemen i have enjoyed this evening immensely the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play and your appreciation has been most intelligent i congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as i do\\u2019\\nwhen wilde had finished lady windermere\\u2019s fan he retired to paris and wrote his biblical play salome in french dedicated to pierre louys who made certain corrections in the french but did not otherwise interfere with it sarah bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play and she put it into rehearsal at the palace theatre in london with herself in the titlerole however the lord chamberlain refused to grant it a licence on the ground that no play which contained biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the english stage this so annoyed wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his british nationality and becoming a frenchman there being no such restrictions in france as matters turned out it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat\\nin the summer of  he wrote a woman of no importance which was produced with immediate success by herbert beerbohm tree at the haymarket in  once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author this time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of lady windermere\\u2019s fan he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced \\u2018ladies and gentlemen i regret to inform you that mr oscar wilde is not in the house\\u2019\\non  january  oscar wilde\\u2019s third important play an ideal husband was produced by lewis waller the prince of wales was present at the first night it was almost unprecedented for royalty to be present at a first night and it seemed now that wilde\\u2019s future was assured george bernard shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating \\u2018mr oscar wilde\\u2019s new play at the haymarket is a dangerous subject because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026he plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with the whole theatre\\u2019\\nand so we come to oscar wilde\\u2019s last and his most brilliant play the importance of being earnest wilde originally wrote the play in four acts as he had written his other three major plays he submitted it in this form to george alexander who with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019 as was usual in those days asked wilde to cut it to three acts when four years later leonard smithers published the play in book form it was this threeact version that he had printed and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern why this has been so is not clear but the play as written by oscar wilde with two extra characters in it is the play as given in this volume as mr philip drake who is responsible for this edition of wilde\\u2019s works remarked it seems a pity that george alexander should have a permanent influence on the play\\n\\n\\n\\nthe importance of being earnestwas produced at the st james\\u2019s theatre on  february  wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the west end and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them then the marquess of queensberry with the object of attacking his son lord alfred douglas because of his friendship with wilde launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on wilde the story has been told often enough alfred douglas whose only object was to see his father in the dock persuaded oscar wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him lord queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by oscar wilde who was sentenced to two years imprisonment\\nwhile in prison wilde wrote the letter to lord alfred douglas part of which was published in  by robert ross under the title of de profundis in a letter to robert ross he wrote \\u2018this is indeed an encyclical letter and as the bulls of the holy father are named from their opening words it may be spoken of as epistola in carcere el vinculis\\u2019 the manuscript was not revised by wilde although he intended to do this as is shown by the letter he wrote to robert ross \\u2018as soon as you have read it i want you to have it copied for me as regards the method of copying i wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections\\u2019 a copy of de profundis was made and sent to alfred douglas but after reading the first few pages he destroyed it probably thinking rather naively that there was no other copy in existence douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself\\nafter my father\\u2019s death in  alfred douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript but robert ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the british museum with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years that is to say until  at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead\\nthe copying was done hastily and without much care because the version printed in  varied in several particulars from the original manuscript although of course the substance was the same the version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as wilde wrote it\\nthe portrait of mr w h was first published as an article of  words in blackwood\\u2019s magazine for july  oscar wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he rewrote the story and added to it bringing the total up to  words the manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at tite street together with others and did not reappear until the year  in america where it was published in a limited edition by mitchell kennerley the expanded version is printed in this edition\\nthe only work that my father wrote after  was the poem the ballad of reading gaol which he wrote at berneval so that douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored as he and wilde did not meet again until later\\nall his life my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the catholic church into which he was received on his death bed in  his remains now lie in the french national cemetery of pere lachaise\\nsource complete works of oscar wilde with an introduction by vyvyan holland collins

massachusetts living there for most of his life along with ralph waldo emerson thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in america and is still widely read today walden  the work for which he is best known is drawn from the journal he kept during his twoyearlong stay in a cabin on walden pond in walden thoreau explores his interests in naturalism individualism and selfsufficiency he is also remembered for his essay civil disobedience  an early influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by mahatma gandhi and under the leadership of martin luther king jr many in the civil rights movementwhere i lived and what i lived for is taken from walden in it thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods writing about walden scholars have pointed out that thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with among other things pies as you read consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to sayby henry david thoreaui went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practice resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a comer and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion for most men it appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it is of the devil or of god and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify god and enjoy him foreverstill we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it is error upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness our life is frittered away by detail an honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump the rest simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumbnail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousandandone items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify instead of three meals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundred dishes five and reduce other things in proportion our life is like a german confederacy made of up petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment the nation itself with all its socalled internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the lands and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stem and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose it lives too fast men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain if we do not get our sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad each one is a man an irishman or a yankee man the rails are laid on them and they are covered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them they are sound sleepers i assure you and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up againwhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life we are determined to be starved before we are hungry men say that a stitch in time saves nine and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow as for work we havent any of any consequence we have the saint vitus dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still if i should only give a few pulls at the parish bellrope as for a fire that is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor a woman i might almost say but would foresake all and follow that sound not mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confess the truth much more to see it bum since bum it must and we be it known did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out and have a hand in it if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parish church itself hardly a man takes a halfhours nap after dinner but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks whats the news as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels some give directions to be waked every halfhour doubtless for no other purpose and then to pay for it they tell what they have dreamed after a nights sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe\\u2014and he reads it over his coffee and rolls that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the wachito river never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world and has but the rudiment of an eye himselfwhen we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the realityfor my part i could easily do without the postoffice i think that there are very few important communications made through it to speak critically i never received more than one or two letters in my life \\u2014 i wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage the pennypost is commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper if we read of one man robbed or murdered or killed bv accident or one house burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or one cow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another one is enough if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care for a myriad instances and applications to a philosopher all news as it is called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea yet not a few are greedy after this gossip there was such a rush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since i saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of  and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character if one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a french revolution not exceptedwhat news how much more important to know what that is which was never old kieouheyu great dignitary of the state of wei sent a man to khoungtseu to know his news khoungtseu caused the messenger to be seated near him and questioned him in these terms what is your master doing the messenger answered with respect my master desires to diminish the number of his faults but he cannot come to the end of them the messenger being gone the philosopher remarked what a worthy messenger what a worthy messenger the preacher instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week\\u2014for sunday is the fit conclusion of an illspent week and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one\\u2014with this one other draggletail of a sermon should shout with thundering voice pause avast why so seeming fast but deadly slowshams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths while reality is fabulous if men would steadily observe realities only and not allow themselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as we know would be like a fairy tale and the arabian nights entertainments if we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be music and poetry would resound along the streets when we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality this is always exhilarating and sublime by closing the eyes and slumbering and consenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built on purely illusory foundations children who play life discern its true law and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthily but who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure i have read in a hindoo book that there was a kings son who being expelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a forester and growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived one of his fathers ministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and the misconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be a prince so soul continues the hindoo philosopher from the circumstances in which it is placed mistakes its own character until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be brahme i perceive that we inhabitants of new england live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things we think that that is which appears to be if a man should walk through this town and see only the reality where think you would the milldam go to if he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there we should not recognize the place in his description look at the meetinghouse or a courthouse or a jail or a shop or a dwellinghouse and say what that thing really is before a true gaze and they would all go to pieces in your account of them men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behind the farthest star before adam and after the last man in eternity there is indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now and here god himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us the universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us let us spend our lives in conceiving then the poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish itlet us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails let us rise early and fast or breakfast gently and without perturbation let company come and let company go let the bells ring and the children cry\\u2014determined to make a day of it why should we knock under and go with the stream let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated in the meridian shallows weather this danger and you are safe for the rest of the way is downhill with unrelaxed nerves with morning vigor sail by it looking another way tied to the mast like ulysses if the engine whistles let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains if the bell rings why should we run we will consider what kind of music they are like let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance that alluvion which covers the globe through paris and london through new york and boston and concord through church and state through poetry and philosophy and religion till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality and say this is and no mistake and then begin having a point dappui below freshet and frost and fire a place where you might found a wall or a state or set a lamppost safely or perhaps a gauge not a nilometer but a realometer that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time if you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces as if it were a cimeter and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow and so you will happily conclude your mortal career be it life or death we crave only reality if we are really dying let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities if we are alive let us go about our businesstime is but the stream i go afishing in i drink at it but while i drink i see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is its thin current slides away but eternity remains i would drink deeper fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with stars i cannot count one i know not the first letter of the alphabet i have always been regretting that i was not as wise as the day i was born the intellect is a cleaver it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things i do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary my head is hands and feet i feel all my best faculties concentrated in it my instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing as some creatures use their snout and fore paws and with it i would mine and burrow my way through these hills i think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts so bv the diviningrod and thin rising vapors i judge and here i will begin to mine \",\n          \" vyvyan holland in his introduction to the  edition of oscar wildes works provides an insightful overview of his fathers lineage life and literary career he recounts the familys dutch origin oscars upbringing and education his rise in london society and his contributions to literature from poetry and essays to renowned plays like the importance of being earnest holland also touches on the darker aspects of wildes life including his trial imprisonment and posthumous conversion to catholicism ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history  introduction to the  editionby vyvyan hollandoscar wildes family is dutch in origin the first wilde to settle in ireland was a certain colonel de wilde the son of an artist examples of whose work hang in the art gallery at the hague he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to king william iii of england he is said to have repented his adherence to the english king and to have become more irish than the irish from that time the family were land agents and doctorsmy fathers parents were both distinguished in their own way sir william wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time and a physician of international repute he invented the operation for cataract and performed it on king oscar of sweden for which he received the order of the polar star his mother lady wilde born jane francesca elgee was a staunch irish nationalist who wrote fierce poems and articles in the irish nationalist newspaper the nation under the name of speranza a name she had adopted from her motto fidanza constanza speranza \\u2013 faith constancy hope lady wilde had three children william oscar and isola who died when she was ten to oscars lasting grief oscar wilde was born on  october  and was given the names oscar fingal oflahertie wills wildehis education began at portora royal school in enniskillen from which he obtained a scholarship to trinity college dublin where he won the berkeley gold medal for greek from there he received a demyship to magdalen college oxford while at oxford he came under the influence of john ruskin and walter pater pater preached the love of art for arts sake and oscar wilde going one step further set out to idolise beauty for beautys sake and filled his rooms looking over the cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by rossetti and burnejones aestheticism was the keynote of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strivemy fathers life at oxford one gathers from his letters was a joyous one he entered wholeheartedly into the undergraduate life of the university and distinguished himself by winning the newdigate prize for english verse and getting a double first in classics upon this note he came to london in  with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen true to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the apostle of aestheticism and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress it must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the british upper middle classes was rigidly conventional and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid kneebreeches black silk stockings a soft loose shirt with a wide turndown collar and a large flowing tie was bound to arouse indignant curiosityat the same time he was writing poems and in  he also wrote vera a rather immature play which ran for one week in new york in  and never reached the boards in london in  his collected poems were published and in  being short of money he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to america this proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to england in  covered if not with glory at least with considerable notorietyon his return to europe he retired to paris to finish another play the duchess of padua for the american actress mary anderson but when she received the play she turned it down flatly this was really a disaster for oscar wilde and he returned to england and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces however this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to london where in  he married constance mary daughter of a distinguished irish barrister horace lloyd qc oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy he had two sons by his wife \\u2013 cyril born in  and myself in oddly enough although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage he now turned largely to prose and with the exception of the sphinx the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment when he wrote the ballad of reading gaol boris brasol who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father sums up his poetic period as followshe began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which however as he himself admitted there was more rhyme than reason yet as he grew older he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry and though there is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which browning aptly called the unlocking of hearts with sonnet keysupon what then does his reputation as an author rest his early poems were mostly lyrical and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time his true literary life was spread over seven years only from  until  in  he had become editor of womans world in which capacity he continued until  when he resigned he had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and still more as a conversationalist there are few people alive now who remember his conversation but when in  a plaque was unveiled by sir compton mackenzie on the house in tite street where my family lived for eleven years he read the following message from sir max beerbohm the incomparable max who felt too frail to undertake the journey to london to be presenti have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 meredith and swinburne edmund gosse and henry james augustine birrell and arthur balfour gilbert chesterton and desmond maccarthy and hilaire belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way but oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished the most soothing and yet the most surprisingnobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso to have heard him consoled me for not having heard dr johnson or edmund burke lord brougham or sidney smithwinston churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life and he replied without hesitation oscar wildewildes first memorable work was the happy prince which appeared in  the stories in the happy prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adultsin  he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously the book was called lord arthur saviles crime and other stories the other three tales being the canterville ghost the sphinx without a secret and the model millionaire the first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions they possess the lighthearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in the importance of being earnest and show the buoyancy of my fathers spirit at that timea house of pomegranates my fathers other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by charles shannon ra in the same year this book completely puzzled the critics who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested quite rightly that no child could understand them this was followed by the sphinx which really dated from his oxford days and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since the critics were again confused by the poem which was really nothing more than an experiment with words he revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque which he rhymed with hippogriff and amenalkin  too oscar wildes only novel the picture of dorian gray appeared in book form enlarged from the original which had been already published in lippincotts magazine the publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics the english press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book the idea of the book had first come to my father some years before hesketh pearson tells the story of it in his life of oscar wilde in the year  wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter basil ward one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beautywhen the portrait was done and the youth had gone wilde happened to say what a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old the artist agreed adding how delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is while the portrait aged and withered in his stead wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story basil hallwardby far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that oscar wilde wrote was intentions in which he really gave rein to his imagination in my own opinion it is the most absorbing of all his works the critic as artist occupies considerably more than half of it its subtitle with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing shows the curious charm the word importance had for him it occurs in the titles of two of his plays and is constantly cropping up in his essays it is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it if not round his tongue then round his mindbut the most interesting essay in the book is the decay of lying the essay is in the form of a dialogue the dominant theme being the vast superiority of art over nature leading to the conclusion that nature follows artoscar wilde now entered into his final stage the one for which he was destined that of a dramatist in  he wrote lady windermeres fan which he described as one of those modern drawingroom plays with pink lampshades it was produced at the st jamess theatre in february  by george alexander there were loud cries of author at the end of the play and wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said ladies and gentlemen i have enjoyed this evening immensely the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play and your appreciation has been most intelligent i congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as i dowhen wilde had finished lady windermeres fan he retired to paris and wrote his biblical play salome in french dedicated to pierre louys who made certain corrections in the french but did not otherwise interfere with it sarah bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play and she put it into rehearsal at the palace theatre in london with herself in the titlerole however the lord chamberlain refused to grant it a licence on the ground that no play which contained biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the english stage this so annoyed wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his british nationality and becoming a frenchman there being no such restrictions in france as matters turned out it is a pity that he did not carry out his threatin the summer of  he wrote a woman of no importance which was produced with immediate success by herbert beerbohm tree at the haymarket in  once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author this time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of lady windermeres fan he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced ladies and gentlemen i regret to inform you that mr oscar wilde is not in the houseon  january  oscar wildes third important play an ideal husband was produced by lewis waller the prince of wales was present at the first night it was almost unprecedented for royalty to be present at a first night and it seemed now that wildes future was assured george bernard shaws comment on the play is worth repeating mr oscar wildes new play at the haymarket is a dangerous subject because he has the property of making his critics dullhe plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with the whole theatreand so we come to oscar wildes last and his most brilliant play the importance of being earnest wilde originally wrote the play in four acts as he had written his other three major plays he submitted it in this form to george alexander who with the object of making room for a curtain raiser as was usual in those days asked wilde to cut it to three acts when four years later leonard smithers published the play in book form it was this threeact version that he had printed and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern why this has been so is not clear but the play as written by oscar wilde with two extra characters in it is the play as given in this volume as mr philip drake who is responsible for this edition of wildes works remarked it seems a pity that george alexander should have a permanent influence on the playthe importance of being earnestwas produced at the st jamess theatre on  february  wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the west end and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them then the marquess of queensberry with the object of attacking his son lord alfred douglas because of his friendship with wilde launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on wilde the story has been told often enough alfred douglas whose only object was to see his father in the dock persuaded oscar wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him lord queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by oscar wilde who was sentenced to two years imprisonmentwhile in prison wilde wrote the letter to lord alfred douglas part of which was published in  by robert ross under the title of de profundis in a letter to robert ross he wrote this is indeed an encyclical letter and as the bulls of the holy father are named from their opening words it may be spoken of as epistola in carcere el vinculis the manuscript was not revised by wilde although he intended to do this as is shown by the letter he wrote to robert ross as soon as you have read it i want you to have it copied for me as regards the method of copying i wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections a copy of de profundis was made and sent to alfred douglas but after reading the first few pages he destroyed it probably thinking rather naively that there was no other copy in existence douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter and he could not go back on this without contradicting himselfafter my fathers death in  alfred douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript but robert ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the british museum with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years that is to say until  at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be deadthe copying was done hastily and without much care because the version printed in  varied in several particulars from the original manuscript although of course the substance was the same the version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as wilde wrote itthe portrait of mr w h was first published as an article of  words in blackwoods magazine for july  oscar wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he rewrote the story and added to it bringing the total up to  words the manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my fathers effects at tite street together with others and did not reappear until the year  in america where it was published in a limited edition by mitchell kennerley the expanded version is printed in this editionthe only work that my father wrote after  was the poem the ballad of reading gaol which he wrote at berneval so that douglass claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored as he and wilde did not meet again until laterall his life my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the catholic church into which he was received on his death bed in  his remains now lie in the french national cemetery of pere lachaisesource complete works of oscar wilde with an introduction by vyvyan holland collins  \"\n        ],\n

massachusetts living there for most of his life along with ralph waldo emerson thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in america and is still widely read today walden  the work for which he is best known is drawn from the journal he kept during his twoyearlong stay in a cabin on walden pond in walden thoreau explores his interests in naturalism individualism and selfsufficiency he is also remembered for his essay civil disobedience  an early influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by mahatma gandhi and under the leadership of martin luther king jr many in the civil rights movementwhere i lived and what i lived for is taken from walden in it thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods writing about walden scholars have pointed out that thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with among other things pies as you read consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to sayby henry david thoreaui went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practice resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a comer and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion for most men it appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it is of the devil or of god and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify god and enjoy him foreverstill we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it is error upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness our life is frittered away by detail an honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump the rest simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumbnail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousandandone items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify instead of three meals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundred dishes five and reduce other things in proportion our life is like a german confederacy made of up petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment the nation itself with all its socalled internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the lands and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stem and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose it lives too fast men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain if we do not get our sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad each one is a man an irishman or a yankee man the rails are laid on them and they are covered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them they are sound sleepers i assure you and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up againwhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life we are determined to be starved before we are hungry men say that a stitch in time saves nine and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow as for work we havent any of any consequence we have the saint vitus dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still if i should only give a few pulls at the parish bellrope as for a fire that is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor a woman i might almost say but would foresake all and follow that sound not mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confess the truth much more to see it bum since bum it must and we be it known did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out and have a hand in it if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parish church itself hardly a man takes a halfhours nap after dinner but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks whats the news as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels some give directions to be waked every halfhour doubtless for no other purpose and then to pay for it they tell what they have dreamed after a nights sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe\\u2014and he reads it over his coffee and rolls that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the wachito river never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world and has but the rudiment of an eye himselfwhen we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the realityfor my part i could easily do without the postoffice i think that there are very few important communications made through it to speak critically i never received more than one or two letters in my life \\u2014 i wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage the pennypost is commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper if we read of one man robbed or murdered or killed bv accident or one house burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or one cow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another one is enough if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care for a myriad instances and applications to a philosopher all news as it is called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea yet not a few are greedy after this gossip there was such a rush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since i saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of  and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character if one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a french revolution not exceptedwhat news how much more important to know what that is which was never old kieouheyu great dignitary of the state of wei sent a man to khoungtseu to know his news khoungtseu caused the messenger to be seated near him and questioned him in these terms what is your master doing the messenger answered with respect my master desires to diminish the number of his faults but he cannot come to the end of them the messenger being gone the philosopher remarked what a worthy messenger what a worthy messenger the preacher instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week\\u2014for sunday is the fit conclusion of an illspent week and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one\\u2014with this one other draggletail of a sermon should shout with thundering voice pause avast why so seeming fast but deadly slowshams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths while reality is fabulous if men would steadily observe realities only and not allow themselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as we know would be like a fairy tale and the arabian nights entertainments if we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be music and poetry would resound along the streets when we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality this is always exhilarating and sublime by closing the eyes and slumbering and consenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built on purely illusory foundations children who play life discern its true law and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthily but who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure i have read in a hindoo book that there was a kings son who being expelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a forester and growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived one of his fathers ministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and the misconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be a prince so soul continues the hindoo philosopher from the circumstances in which it is placed mistakes its own character until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be brahme i perceive that we inhabitants of new england live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things we think that that is which appears to be if a man should walk through this town and see only the reality where think you would the milldam go to if he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there we should not recognize the place in his description look at the meetinghouse or a courthouse or a jail or a shop or a dwellinghouse and say what that thing really is before a true gaze and they would all go to pieces in your account of them men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behind the farthest star before adam and after the last man in eternity there is indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now and here god himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us the universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us let us spend our lives in conceiving then the poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish itlet us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails let us rise early and fast or breakfast gently and without perturbation let company come and let company go let the bells ring and the children cry\\u2014determined to make a day of it why should we knock under and go with the stream let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated in the meridian shallows weather this danger and you are safe for the rest of the way is downhill with unrelaxed nerves with morning vigor sail by it looking another way tied to the mast like ulysses if the engine whistles let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains if the bell rings why should we run we will consider what kind of music they are like let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance that alluvion which covers the globe through paris and london through new york and boston and concord through church and state through poetry and philosophy and religion till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality and say this is and no mistake and then begin having a point dappui below freshet and frost and fire a place where you might found a wall or a state or set a lamppost safely or perhaps a gauge not a nilometer but a realometer that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time if you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces as if it were a cimeter and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow and so you will happily conclude your mortal career be it life or death we crave only reality if we are really dying let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities if we are alive let us go about our businesstime is but the stream i go afishing in i drink at it but while i drink i see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is its thin current slides away but eternity remains i would drink deeper fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with stars i cannot count one i know not the first letter of the alphabet i have always been regretting that i was not as wise as the day i was born the intellect is a cleaver it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things i do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary my head is hands and feet i feel all my best faculties concentrated in it my instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing as some creatures use their snout and fore paws and with it i would mine and burrow my way through these hills i think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts so bv the diviningrod and thin rising vapors i judge and here i will begin to mine \",\n          \" vyvyan holland in his introduction to the  edition of oscar wildes works provides an insightful overview of his fathers lineage life and literary career he recounts the familys dutch origin oscars upbringing and education his rise in london society and his contributions to literature from poetry and essays to renowned plays like the importance of being earnest holland also touches on the darker aspects of wildes life including his trial imprisonment and posthumous conversion to catholicism ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history  introduction to the  editionby vyvyan hollandoscar wildes family is dutch in origin the first wilde to settle in ireland was a certain colonel de wilde the son of an artist examples of whose work hang in the art gallery at the hague he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to king william iii of england he is said to have repented his adherence to the english king and to have become more irish than the irish from that time the family were land agents and doctorsmy fathers parents were both distinguished in their own way sir william wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time and a physician of international repute he invented the operation for cataract and performed it on king oscar of sweden for which he received the order of the polar star his mother lady wilde born jane francesca elgee was a staunch irish nationalist who wrote fierce poems and articles in the irish nationalist newspaper the nation under the name of speranza a name she had adopted from her motto fidanza constanza speranza \\u2013 faith constancy hope lady wilde had three children william oscar and isola who died when she was ten to oscars lasting grief oscar wilde was born on  october  and was given the names oscar fingal oflahertie wills wildehis education began at portora royal school in enniskillen from which he obtained a scholarship to trinity college dublin where he won the berkeley gold medal for greek from there he received a demyship to magdalen college oxford while at oxford he came under the influence of john ruskin and walter pater pater preached the love of art for arts sake and oscar wilde going one step further set out to idolise beauty for beautys sake and filled his rooms looking over the cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by rossetti and burnejones aestheticism was the keynote of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strivemy fathers life at oxford one gathers from his letters was a joyous one he entered wholeheartedly into the undergraduate life of the university and distinguished himself by winning the newdigate prize for english verse and getting a double first in classics upon this note he came to london in  with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen true to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the apostle of aestheticism and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress it must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the british upper middle classes was rigidly conventional and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid kneebreeches black silk stockings a soft loose shirt with a wide turndown collar and a large flowing tie was bound to arouse indignant curiosityat the same time he was writing poems and in  he also wrote vera a rather immature play which ran for one week in new york in  and never reached the boards in london in  his collected poems were published and in  being short of money he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to america this proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to england in  covered if not with glory at least with considerable notorietyon his return to europe he retired to paris to finish another play the duchess of padua for the american actress mary anderson but when she received the play she turned it down flatly this was really a disaster for oscar wilde and he returned to england and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces however this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to london where in  he married constance mary daughter of a distinguished irish barrister horace lloyd qc oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy he had two sons by his wife \\u2013 cyril born in  and myself in oddly enough although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage he now turned largely to prose and with the exception of the sphinx the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment when he wrote the ballad of reading gaol boris brasol who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father sums up his poetic period as followshe began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which however as he himself admitted there was more rhyme than reason yet as he grew older he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry and though there is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which browning aptly called the unlocking of hearts with sonnet keysupon what then does his reputation as an author rest his early poems were mostly lyrical and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time his true literary life was spread over seven years only from  until  in  he had become editor of womans world in which capacity he continued until  when he resigned he had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and still more as a conversationalist there are few people alive now who remember his conversation but when in  a plaque was unveiled by sir compton mackenzie on the house in tite street where my family lived for eleven years he read the following message from sir max beerbohm the incomparable max who felt too frail to undertake the journey to london to be presenti have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 meredith and swinburne edmund gosse and henry james augustine birrell and arthur balfour gilbert chesterton and desmond maccarthy and hilaire belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way but

children and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adultsin  he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously the book was called lord arthur saviles crime and other stories the other three tales being the canterville ghost the sphinx without a secret and the model millionaire the first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions they possess the lighthearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in the importance of being earnest and show the buoyancy of my fathers spirit at that timea house of pomegranates my fathers other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by charles shannon ra in the same year this book completely puzzled the critics who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested quite rightly that no child could understand them this was followed by the sphinx which really dated from his oxford days and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since the critics were again confused by the poem which was really nothing more than an experiment with words he revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque which he rhymed with hippogriff and amenalkin  too oscar wildes only novel the picture of dorian gray appeared in book form enlarged from the original which had been already published in lippincotts magazine the publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics the english press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book the idea of the book had first come to my father some years before hesketh pearson tells the story of it in his life of oscar wilde in the year  wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter basil ward one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beautywhen the portrait was done and the youth had gone wilde happened to say what a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old the artist agreed adding how delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is while the portrait aged and withered in his stead wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story basil hallwardby far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that oscar wilde wrote was intentions in which he really gave rein to his imagination in my own opinion it is the most absorbing of all his works the critic as artist occupies considerably more than half of it its subtitle with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing shows the curious charm the word importance had for him it occurs in the titles of two of his plays and is constantly cropping up in his essays it is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it if not round his tongue then round his mindbut the most interesting essay in the book is the decay of lying the essay is in the form of a dialogue the dominant theme being the vast superiority of art over nature leading to the conclusion that nature follows artoscar wilde now entered into his final stage the one for which he was destined that of a dramatist in  he wrote lady windermeres fan which he described as one of those modern drawingroom plays with pink lampshades it was produced at the st jamess theatre in february  by george alexander there were loud cries of author at the end of the play and wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said ladies and gentlemen i have enjoyed this evening immensely the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play and your appreciation has been most intelligent i congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as i dowhen wilde had finished lady windermeres fan he retired to paris and wrote his biblical play salome in french dedicated to pierre louys who made certain corrections in the french but did not otherwise interfere with it sarah bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play and she put it into rehearsal at the palace theatre in london with herself in the titlerole however the lord chamberlain refused to grant it a licence on the ground that no play which contained biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the english stage this so annoyed wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his british nationality and becoming a frenchman there being no such restrictions in france as matters turned out it is a pity that he did not carry out his threatin the summer of  he wrote a woman of no importance which was produced with immediate success by herbert beerbohm tree at the haymarket in  once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author this time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of lady windermeres fan he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced ladies and gentlemen i regret to inform you that mr oscar wilde is not in the houseon  january  oscar wildes third important play an ideal husband was produced by lewis waller the prince of wales was present at the first night it was almost unprecedented for royalty to be present at a first night and it seemed now that wildes future was assured george bernard shaws comment on the play is worth repeating mr oscar wildes new play at the haymarket is a dangerous subject because he has the property of making his critics dullhe plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with the whole theatreand so we come to oscar wildes last and his most brilliant play the importance of being earnest wilde originally wrote the play in four acts as he had written his other three major plays he submitted it in this form to george alexander who with the object of making room for a curtain raiser as was usual in those days asked wilde to cut it to three acts when four years later leonard smithers published the play in book form it was this threeact version that he had printed and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern why this has been so is not clear but the play as written by oscar wilde with two extra characters in it is the play as given in this volume as mr philip drake who is responsible for this edition of wildes works remarked it seems a pity that george alexander should have a permanent influence on the playthe importance of being earnestwas produced at the st jamess theatre on  february  wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the west end and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them then the marquess of queensberry with the object of attacking his son lord alfred douglas because of his friendship with wilde launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on wilde the story has been told often enough alfred douglas whose only object was to see his father in the dock persuaded oscar wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him lord queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by oscar wilde who was sentenced to two years imprisonmentwhile in prison wilde wrote the letter to lord alfred douglas part of which was published in  by robert ross under the title of de profundis in a letter to robert ross he wrote this is indeed an encyclical letter and as the bulls of the holy father are named from their opening words it may be spoken of as epistola in carcere el vinculis the manuscript was not revised by wilde although he intended to do this as is shown by the letter he wrote to robert ross as soon as you have read it i want you to have it copied for me as regards the method of copying i wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections a copy of de profundis was made and sent to alfred douglas but after reading the first few pages he destroyed it probably thinking rather naively that there was no other copy in existence douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter and he could not go back on this without contradicting himselfafter my fathers death in  alfred douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript but robert ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the british museum with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years that is to say until  at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be deadthe copying was done hastily and without much care because the version printed in  varied in several particulars from the original manuscript although of course the substance was the same the version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as wilde wrote itthe portrait of mr w h was first published as an article of  words in blackwoods magazine for july  oscar wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he rewrote the story and added to it bringing the total up to  words the manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my fathers effects at tite street together with others and did not reappear until the year  in america where it was published in a limited edition by mitchell kennerley the expanded version is printed in this editionthe only work that my father wrote after  was the poem the ballad of reading gaol which he wrote at berneval so that douglass claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored as he and wilde did not meet again until laterall his life my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the catholic church into which he was received on his death bed in  his remains now lie in the french national cemetery of pere lachaisesource complete works of oscar wilde with an introduction by vyvyan holland collins  \"\n        ],\n

With a career that spanned several decades, Greenburg was celebrated for his sharp wit and satirical writing, which shone brightly across a diverse body of work, including books, essays, screenplays, and more. He made a significant mark in literature and entertainment, poking fun at a wide range of subjects with a unique blend of humor and insight.\\nHis most notable work, \\u201cHow to Be a Jewish Mother,\\u201d humorously dissected the stereotypical Jewish mother, offering advice with a tongue-in-cheek tone that captivated readers nationwide. The book became a cultural touchstone, reflecting Greenburg\\u2019s ability to observe and satirize the nuances of everyday life. Despite its specific cultural references, the book\\u2019s underlying themes of familial love and the complexities of identity resonated with a broad audience, making it a bestseller.\\nBorn in Chicago, Greenburg\\u2019s career spanned various genres, from horror and the occult to murder mysteries and children\\u2019s literature, reflecting his versatile talent and boundless creativity. His series, \\u201cThe Zack Files,\\u201d inspired by his son, Zack O\\u2019Malley Greenburg, brought laughter and adventure to young readers globally, showcasing his ability to engage and entertain audiences of all ages.\\nGreenburg\\u2019s life was filled with intriguing episodes and encounters that often found their way into his work. One such memorable moment occurred during a lunch with his Playboy editor in 1972. Tasked with the daunting prospect of participating in an orgy for a humorous essay, Greenburg\\u2019s characteristic shyness came to the forefront. This real-life awkwardness and vulnerability made his writing all the more relatable and endearing.\\nHis personal life, particularly his first marriage to journalist Nora Ephron, influenced his work significantly. Their relationship and subsequent amicable divorce provided fodder for his writing, illustrating his ability to infuse personal experiences with humor and poignancy. Greenburg\\u2019s subsequent marriages and life experiences continued to shape his perspective and work, adding layers of depth and authenticity.\\nThroughout his career, Greenburg tackled a wide array of subjects, from the paranormal to neurotic sexual fantasies, earning praise and respect for his insightful yet humorous take on various themes. His examination of the paranormal in \\u201cSomething\\u2019s There\\u201d was lauded for its skeptical and street-smart perspective. Critics and fans alike appreciated his enduring sense of humor, even as he ventured into exploring more complex and darker topics.\\nDespite achieving fame and success, Greenburg\\u2019s journey wasn\\u2019t without its challenges. His divorce from Ephron and the legal battles that ensued marked one of his life\\u2019s toughest periods. However, these experiences only added depth to his work, making him a beloved figure in satirical literature. His resilience and ability to transform personal adversity into humor and art are part of what made his work so impactful and enduring.\\nDan Greenburg\\u2019s legacy lives on through his writing, which continues to entertain and provoke thought in readers of all ages. His ability to find humor in life\\u2019s complexities made him a unique voice in literature and a cherished storyteller whose work will be enjoyed for generations to come. As we reflect on his life and contributions, we are reminded of the power of humor to connect, heal, and reveal the truths of the human experience. Greenburg\\u2019s pen might have been laid to rest, but the laughter and insights it provoked will continue to resonate, making our world a bit brighter and more bearable.\\nDaniel Greenburg\\u00a0(June 20, 1936 \\u2013 December 18, 2023)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nHenry David Thoreau was born in 1817 and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, living there for most of his life. Along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in America and is still widely read today. Walden (1854), the work for which he is best known, is drawn from the journal he kept during his two-year-long stay in a cabin on Walden Pond. In Walden, Thoreau explores his interests in naturalism, individualism, and self-sufficiency. He is also remembered for his essay \\u201cCivil Disobedience\\u201d (1849), an early, influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., many in the civil rights movement.\\n\\u201cWhere I Lived, and What I Lived For\\u201d is taken from Walden. In it, Thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods. Writing about Walden, scholars have pointed out that Thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with, among other things, pies. As you read, consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to say.\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a comer, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to \\u201cglorify God and enjoy him forever.\\u201d\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made of up petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the lands; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stem and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get our sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over, so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again.\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven\\u2019t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus\\u2019 dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would foresake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it bum, since bum it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half-hour\\u2019s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the news?\\u201d as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night\\u2019s sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. \\u201cPray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe\\u201d\\u2014and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.\\n\\u201cWhen we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.\\u201d\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life \\u2014 I wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed bv accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth, or twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers; and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old! \\u201cKieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy messenger!\\u201d The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week\\u2014for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one\\u2014with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, \\u201cPause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?\\u201d\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights\\u2019 Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that \\u201cthere was a kings son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his fathers ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,\\u201d continues the Hindoo philosopher, \\u201cfrom the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be Brahme.\\u201d I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the \\u201cMilldam\\u201d go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at the meetinghouse, or a courthouse, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or breakfast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry\\u2014determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is downhill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like. Let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through Church and State, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a point d\\u2019appui, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamppost safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business.\\nTime is but the stream I go afishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so bv the divining-rod and thin rising vapors, I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

His series, \\u201cThe Zack Files,\\u201d inspired by his son, Zack O\\u2019Malley Greenburg, brought laughter and adventure to young readers globally, showcasing his ability to engage and entertain audiences of all ages.\\nGreenburg\\u2019s life was filled with intriguing episodes and encounters that often found their way into his work. One such memorable moment occurred during a lunch with his Playboy editor in 1972. Tasked with the daunting prospect of participating in an orgy for a humorous essay, Greenburg\\u2019s characteristic shyness came to the forefront. This real-life awkwardness and vulnerability made his writing all the more relatable and endearing.\\nHis personal life, particularly his first marriage to journalist Nora Ephron, influenced his work significantly. Their relationship and subsequent amicable divorce provided fodder for his writing, illustrating his ability to infuse personal experiences with humor and poignancy. Greenburg\\u2019s subsequent marriages and life experiences continued to shape his perspective and work, adding layers of depth and authenticity.\\nThroughout his career, Greenburg tackled a wide array of subjects, from the paranormal to neurotic sexual fantasies, earning praise and respect for his insightful yet humorous take on various themes. His examination of the paranormal in \\u201cSomething\\u2019s There\\u201d was lauded for its skeptical and street-smart perspective. Critics and fans alike appreciated his enduring sense of humor, even as he ventured into exploring more complex and darker topics.\\nDespite achieving fame and success, Greenburg\\u2019s journey wasn\\u2019t without its challenges. His divorce from Ephron and the legal battles that ensued marked one of his life\\u2019s toughest periods. However, these experiences only added depth to his work, making him a beloved figure in satirical literature. His resilience and ability to transform personal adversity into humor and art are part of what made his work so impactful and enduring.\\nDan Greenburg\\u2019s legacy lives on through his writing, which continues to entertain and provoke thought in readers of all ages. His ability to find humor in life\\u2019s complexities made him a unique voice in literature and a cherished storyteller whose work will be enjoyed for generations to come. As we reflect on his life and contributions, we are reminded of the power of humor to connect, heal, and reveal the truths of the human experience. Greenburg\\u2019s pen might have been laid to rest, but the laughter and insights it provoked will continue to resonate, making our world a bit brighter and more bearable.\\nDaniel Greenburg\\u00a0(June 20, 1936 \\u2013 December 18, 2023)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nHenry David Thoreau was born in 1817 and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, living there for most of his life. Along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in America and is still widely read today. Walden (1854), the work for which he is best known, is drawn from the journal he kept during his two-year-long stay in a cabin on Walden Pond. In Walden, Thoreau explores his interests in naturalism, individualism, and self-sufficiency. He is also remembered for his essay \\u201cCivil Disobedience\\u201d (1849), an early, influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., many in the civil rights movement.\\n\\u201cWhere I Lived, and What I Lived For\\u201d is taken from Walden. In it, Thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods. Writing about Walden, scholars have pointed out that Thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with, among other things, pies. As you read, consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to say.\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a comer, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to \\u201cglorify God and enjoy him forever.\\u201d\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made of up petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the lands; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stem and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get our sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over, so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again.\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven\\u2019t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus\\u2019 dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would foresake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it bum, since bum it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire\\u2014or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half-hour\\u2019s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the news?\\u201d as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half-hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night\\u2019s sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. \\u201cPray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe\\u201d\\u2014and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.\\n\\u201cWhen we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality.\\u201d\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life \\u2014 I wrote this some years ago \\u2014 that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed bv accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter\\u2014we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure\\u2014news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth, or twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions \\u2014 they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers \\u2014 and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers; and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old! \\u201cKieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy messenger!\\u201d The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week\\u2014for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one\\u2014with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, \\u201cPause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?\\u201d\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights\\u2019 Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that \\u201cthere was a kings son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his fathers ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,\\u201d continues the Hindoo philosopher, \\u201cfrom the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be Brahme.\\u201d I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the \\u201cMilldam\\u201d go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at the meetinghouse, or a courthouse, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or breakfast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry\\u2014determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is downhill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like. Let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through Church and State, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a point d\\u2019appui, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamppost safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business.\\nTime is but the stream I go afishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so bv the divining-rod and thin rising vapors, I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"YANIS VAROUFAKIS\",\n          \"JOHN GRAY\",\n          \"HENRY\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            " henry david thoreau was born in and raised in concord massachusetts living there for most of his life along with ralph waldo emerson thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in america and is still widely read today walden the work for which he is best known is drawn from the journal he kept during his twoyearlong stay in a cabin on walden pond in walden thoreau explores his interests in naturalism individualism and selfsufficiency he is also remembered for his essay civil disobedience an early influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by mahatma gandhi and under the leadership of martin luther king jr many in the civil rights movementwhere i lived and what i lived for is taken from walden in it thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods writing about walden scholars have pointed out that thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with among other things pies as you read consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to sayby henry david thoreaui went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practice resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a comer and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion for most men it appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it is of the devil or of god and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify god and enjoy him foreverstill we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it is error upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness our life is frittered away by detail an honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump the rest simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumbnail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousandandone items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify instead of three meals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundred dishes five and reduce other things in proportion our life is like a german confederacy made of up petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment the nation itself with all its socalled internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the lands and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stem and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose it lives too fast men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain if we do not get our sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad each one is a man an irishman or a yankee man the rails are laid on them and they are covered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them they are sound sleepers i assure you and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up againwhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life we are determined to be starved before we are hungry men say that a stitch in time saves nine and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow as for work we havent any of any consequence we have the saint vitus dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still if i should only give a few pulls at the parish bellrope as for a fire that is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor a woman i might almost say but would foresake all and follow that sound not mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confess the truth much more to see it bum since bum it must and we be it known did not set it on fire—or to see it put out and have a hand in it if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parish church itself hardly a man takes a halfhours nap after dinner but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks whats the news as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels some give directions to be waked every halfhour doubtless for no other purpose and then to pay for it they tell what they have dreamed after a nights sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe—and he reads it over his coffee and rolls that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the wachito river never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world and has but the rudiment of an eye himselfwhen we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the realityfor my part i could easily do without the postoffice i think that there are very few important communications made through it to speak critically i never received more than one or two letters in my life — i wrote this some years ago — that were worth the postage the pennypost is commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper if we read of one man robbed or murdered or killed bv accident or one house burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or one cow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter—we never need read of another one is enough if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care for a myriad instances and applications to a philosopher all news as it is called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea yet not a few are greedy after this gossip there was such a rush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken bv the pressure—news which i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportions — they may have changed the names a little since i saw the papers — and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character if one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a french revolution not exceptedwhat news how much more important to know what that is which was never old kieouheyu great dignitary of the state of wei sent a man to khoungtseu to know his news khoungtseu caused the messenger to be seated near him and questioned him in these terms what is your master doing the messenger answered with respect my master desires to diminish the number of his faults but he cannot come to the end of them the messenger being gone the philosopher remarked what a worthy messenger what a worthy messenger the preacher instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week—for sunday is the fit conclusion of an illspent week and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one—with this one other draggletail of a sermon should shout with thundering voice pause avast why so seeming fast but deadly slowshams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths while reality is fabulous if men would steadily observe realities only and not allow themselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as we know would be like a fairy tale and the arabian nights entertainments if we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be music and poetry would resound along the streets when we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality this is always exhilarating and sublime by closing the eyes and slumbering and consenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built on purely illusory foundations children who play life discern its true law and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthily but who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure i have read in a hindoo book that there was a kings son who being expelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a forester and growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived one of his fathers ministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and the misconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be a prince so soul continues the hindoo philosopher from the circumstances in which it is placed mistakes its own character until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be brahme i perceive that we inhabitants of new england live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things we think that that is which appears to be if a man should walk through this town and see only the reality where think you would the milldam go to if he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there we should not recognize the place in his description look at the meetinghouse or a courthouse or a jail or a shop or a dwellinghouse and say what that thing really is before a true gaze and they would all go to pieces in your account of them men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behind the farthest star before adam and after the last man in eternity there is indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now and here god himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us the universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us let us spend our lives in conceiving then the poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish itlet us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails let us rise early and fast or breakfast gently and without perturbation let company come and let company go let the bells ring and the children cry—determined to make a day of it why should we knock under and go with the stream let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated in the meridian shallows weather this danger and you are safe for the rest of the way is downhill with unrelaxed nerves with morning vigor sail by it looking another way tied to the mast like ulysses if the engine whistles let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains if the bell rings why should we run we will consider what kind of music they are like let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance that alluvion which covers the globe through paris and london through new york and boston and concord through church and state through poetry and philosophy and religion till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality and say this is and no mistake and then begin having a point dappui below freshet and frost and fire a place where you might found a wall or a state or set a lamppost safely or perhaps a gauge not a nilometer but a realometer that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time if you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces as if it were a cimeter and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow and so you will happily conclude your mortal career be it life or death we crave only reality if we are really dying let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities if we are alive let us go about our businesstime is but the stream i go afishing in i drink at it but while i drink i see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is its thin current slides away but eternity remains i would drink deeper fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with stars i cannot count one i know not the first letter of the alphabet i have always been regretting that i was not as wise as the day i was born the intellect is a cleaver it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things i do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary my head is hands and feet i feel all my best faculties concentrated in it my instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing as some creatures use their snout and fore paws and with it i would mine and burrow my way through these hills i think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts so bv the diviningrod and thin rising vapors i judge and here i will begin to mine \n",
            " crossroads of empire john grays vision of political realignment and the fate of the westjohn gray the prolific political philosopher has long been a figure of intrigue and controversy over the past halfcentury gray has navigated the intellectual currents of political thought never comfortably fitting into a single ideological box his ability to provoke thought across the political spectrum is perhaps best encapsulated in his latest work which examines the changing fortunes of the west through a prism of revived historical paradigms feudalism religious orthodoxy and ultranationalismgrays central thesis challenges the modern consensus on growth and progress suggesting that neither are guaranteed nor inevitable this perspective underpins his broader critique of globalization and liberal capitalism positions that have brought him both acclaim and criticism his skepticism towards the wests commitment to these ideologies has proven prescient with his early critiques of globalization and the pitfalls of military occupations in afghanistan and iraq now widely acknowledged as accuratein his recent book the new leviathans thoughts after liberalism gray turns his attention to what he perceives as the declining trajectory of western dominance proposing that the future may see a return to older forms of social organization and governance this outlook is deeply intertwined with his critique of contemporary liberal policies which he argues have inadvertently fueled the rise of populism gray sees populism not as an aberration but as a direct backlash against the social disruptions caused by liberal economic and cultural policiescentral to grays analysis is the idea that western liberalism with its emphasis on individual autonomy and economic deregulation has reached a critical juncture he suggests that the crises facing the west today are symptomatic of deeper ideological failures these include a misplaced faith in the universality of liberal democracy and capitalism which in his view have led to increasing social fragmentation and economic inequality gray argues that the responses to these crises from both the political left and right have been largely inadequate mired in outdated modes of thinking that fail to address the root causes of contemporary malaisemoreover gray posits that the current moment represents a crossroads for the west one that requires a fundamental reevaluation of its values and political systems he envisions a future in which the west might see a resurgence of forms of social organization that have historically been associated with premodern societies this includes a revival of feudalistic structures a return to more orthodox religious practices and a strengthening of ultranationalist sentiments according to gray these developments are not necessarily regressive but reflect a complex interplay of historical cultural and economic forces that challenge the linear conception of history as a progression towards liberal democracy and capitalismgrays critique extends beyond mere political analysis delving into the philosophical underpinnings of western thought he challenges the enlightenment belief in reason and progress suggesting that such ideals have led to an overconfidence in the ability of liberal democracy and capitalism to address the fundamental challenges of human existence instead gray calls for a more nuanced understanding of human nature and history one that recognizes the limitations of rationalism and the inevitability of cyclical patterns of social and political organizationin conclusion john grays work represents a provocative challenge to the conventional wisdom regarding the wests past present and future by drawing on a wide array of historical philosophical and political insights gray offers a compelling critique of the assumptions that have shaped western thought for centuries his analysis suggests that the west may be on the cusp of a profound transformation one that could see the resurgence of older forms of social organization and governance whether one agrees with grays conclusions or not his work undeniably provides a rich source of reflection on the complexities of contemporary political life and the unpredictable nature of historical change aaron bastanis interview with john gray covers a broad range of topics delving into his critiques of globalization liberalism and the current political and economic trajectory of the west here are the key points discussed• critique of globalization and liberalism gray criticized the optimistic belief in inevitable globalization and liberal democracy arguing that these trends are neither inevitable nor universally beneficial his skepticism towards globalization which he expressed in his earlier work was met with widespread criticism at the time but has since been vindicated by events• skepticism towards progress he challenges the notion of inevitable progress and growth suggesting that history is cyclical rather than linear and that we may be returning to older forms of living and governance such as feudalism ultranationalism and religious orthodoxy• critique of western policies and populism gray links the rise of populism to the social disruptions caused by policies from liberal elites arguing they fail to see the connection between their actions and the political blowback they receiveviews on the future of the west he predicts a shift away from the ideologies and structures that have dominated recent decades suggesting a return to more traditional possibly premodern forms of social organization• the role of religion and nationalism contrary to the expectations of liberal universalism gray highlights the resurgence of nationalism and religion as central forces in global politics underscoring their role in the collapse of communism and the ongoing resistance to liberal hegemony• economic critiques gray criticizes the current economic system predicting further fragmentation and the potential for a return to more localized less globalized economic models he sees the current trend towards deglobalization as an acknowledgment of the failures of the globalizing project• criticism of the european union eu he views the eu as a flawed project arguing that it is designed to prevent the emergence of socialism or moderate social democracy favoring a neoliberal economic model instead• hyperliberal ideology and its consequences gray critiques the rise of what he calls hyperliberal ideology seeing it as an extension of western liberalism that paradoxically seeks to undermine western values he associates it with the elites attempt to secure power amidst capitalisms failures• predictions for american politics gray foresees a legitimation crisis in the united states with increasing political polarization and a potential inward turn reducing its global influence and commitments• views on political and ethical choices he discusses the inevitability of tragic choices in politics where any action or inaction involves irreparable losses or wrongs challenging the notion that perfect solutions exist for societal problemsgrays perspective offers a critical and often contrarian view of contemporary political and economic trends questioning the assumptions underlying liberal democracy globalization and the notion of inevitable progress the nonsense of centrismjohn grays critique of centrism is multifaceted and reflects his broader skepticism towards dominant political ideologies and narratives when he refers to the nonsense of centrism he is critiquing a political stance that positions itself as a moderate or middle ground between the perceived extremes of left and right politics here are the key aspects of grays critique• centrism as a hollow ideology gray views centrism not as a coherent ideology with substantive policies but as a political stance that often lacks depth and fails to address the underlying issues facing society centrists claim to offer pragmatic solutions yet their policies may be disconnected from the realities of widespread inequality social fragmentation and the dissatisfaction of large segments of the population• failure to address structural problems centrism in grays view often represents an attempt to maintain the status quo by making minor adjustments rather than tackling the root causes of economic and social issues this approach can be seen as inadequate in times of significant upheaval or when faced with systemic challenges such as those brought about by globalization technological change and environmental crises• the illusion of a nonideological stance centrists often claim to be above the fray of ideological battles positioning themselves as rational and evidencebased arbiters however gray would argue that this is an illusion and that centrism itself is ideologically driven promoting a particular vision of society that upholds existing power structures and economic models• disconnection from popular sentiments gray suggests that centrism is often out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of ordinary people by focusing on a narrow band of policies deemed acceptable by political and economic elites centrists can alienate large portions of the electorate who feel their voices and concerns are not being heard• convergence of political parties one consequence of centrism according to gray is the convergence of major political parties around a set of neoliberal policies reducing the diversity of political options available to voters this convergence can lead to voter apathy and disillusionment with the political process as significant differences between parties become harder to discern• populism as a reaction to centrism gray links the rise of populism in part to the failures of centrism populist movements can be seen as a backlash against the perceived elitism and ineffectiveness of centrist policies tapping into feelings of neglect and disenfranchisement among the publicjohn grays critique of centrism is that it fails to adequately address the complex challenges facing modern societies often serves to preserve the status quo at the expense of meaningful change and can contribute to political polarization and the rise of populist movements by neglecting the concerns of large segments of the population how the uk is facing collapse according to john grayjohn grays insights on the potential for the uks collapse are interwoven with his broader critiques of globalization liberal ideology and the political and economic trajectories of western societies while he doesnt predict a literal collapse in the sense of a sudden disintegration his analysis suggests a series of challenges and transformations that could fundamentally alter the uks future stability and prosperity key themes from grays perspective include• economic fragility and inequality gray highlights the uks vulnerability due to its highly financialized economy and dependence on global financial markets he suggests that the economic model adopted by the uk heavily reliant on finance and service industries is susceptible to global economic shocks and crises leading to increased inequality and social fragmentation• political disintegration and legitimation crisis he argues that the uk is experiencing a crisis of legitimacy where increasing segments of the population no longer feel represented by the political establishment this is exacerbated by the polarization over issues like brexit and the rise of nationalist sentiments in scotland and northern ireland threatening the unity of the united kingdom• impact of brexit gray discusses brexit as a symptom of deeper societal divides and an example of the elites failure to anticipate or understand the consequences of their policies the process of leaving the eu has exposed and intensified existing political and economic vulnerabilities including challenges to the uks global standing and economic stability• social and cultural divisions the rise of what gray terms hyperliberal ideology contributes to social and cultural divisions alienating large portions of the population who do not identify with elitedriven narratives on issues like identity nationalism and sovereignty this ideological divide is seen as deepening the uks internal conflicts• deglobalization and the return to nationalism as part of a broader global trend the uk is facing the challenges of deglobalization with potential shifts towards more localized economies and the resurgence of nationalism gray suggests this could lead to a reevaluation of the uks economic model and its place in the world• challenges to public services and welfare the uks public services and welfare state face significant pressures from economic austerity demographic changes and political decisions that prioritize marketdriven approaches over social cohesion and equityjohn grays analysis implies that the uk is at a crossroads facing significant economic political and social challenges that could lead to a profound transformation or collapse of its current societal model he suggests that addressing these challenges will require rethinking deeply held assumptions about progress governance and the role of the state in regulating the economy and ensuring social welfare why dune is the most worthwhile work of science fictionjohn grays remarks on dune focus on several key aspects that highlight its distinction and depth as a work of science fiction here are the specific points he made• feudal future gray appreciates dune for its depiction of a feudal future a concept that stands out within the science fiction genre unlike many other scifi narratives that envision a future dominated by advanced technology and egalitarian societies dune imagines a future where society has regressed or evolved into a neofeudal state this setting is not only unique but also serves as a critique of the assumption that human society will inevitably progress toward more democratic forms of governance• complex social forms the novels exploration of complex social forms including loyalty hierarchy and religious obligations resonates with grays interests in the diversity of human social organization and the persistence of premodern structures in the future dune presents a society where these elements are central challenging the notion that they will be erased by future advancements• richness of the novels universe gray highlights the richness of the novels universe which includes elements of shamanism divination and practices reminiscent of roman and prefeudal societies this complexity makes dune much more interesting to him than other science fiction works that might adhere more strictly to a linear progression of history or a simplistic view of the future• critique of progress narratives implicit in grays appreciation for dune is a critique of progress narratives common in both science fiction and broader cultural expectations by presenting a future that revisits feudalism and integrates ancient practices into its social fabric dune aligns with grays skepticism about the inevitability of progress and the desirability of a future dominated by liberal technocratic or homogeneous global cultures• science fiction as a lens on the present finally gray values dune for its ability to use the science fiction genre as a lens to view and critique the present the novels engagement with themes of power ecology and society offers insights into contemporary issues making it a valuable work for understanding human nature and the potential paths of our social and political evolutionjohn grays remarks on dune emphasize its unique contribution to science fiction through its exploration of a feudal future complex social dynamics and its critique of progress narratives making it a work that resonates with his own philosophical inquiries criticism of the european union eujohn grays criticism of the european union eu reflects deep concerns about the structural and ideological underpinnings of the organization he views the eu as embodying a particular economic and political philosophy that prioritizes market liberalization deregulation and the interests of capital over those of labor and broader social welfare this perspective suggests that the eu despite its claims of promoting integration and cooperation among european nations fundamentally serves to entrench a neoliberal economic model heres grays critique• neoliberal economic policies gray argues that the eu has been instrumental in promoting and enforcing neoliberal economic policies across its member states these policies include the free movement of capital strict fiscal austerity measures and the privatization of public services while these measures are often justified in the name of efficiency and economic growth gray contends that they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and corporate interests at the expense of the working class and the public sector• constraints on national economic policies one of grays critical points is that the eus framework significantly limits the ability of member states to pursue independent economic policies especially those that might veer towards socialism or social democracy for example the eus economic governance mechanisms such as the stability and growth pact impose strict fiscal rules that discourage expansive public spending or investment in social services this according to gray stifles the possibility of member states adopting more redistributive economic models that could address inequality and social needs more effectively• democratic deficit gray also touches on the issue of the eus socalled democratic deficit where decisionmaking processes are perceived as being removed from the direct influence or control of the citizens of member states this criticism is tied to the economic concerns as the direction of eu policy—especially in economic matters—is often determined by unelected officials in brussels or influenced heavily by corporate lobbying the result is a governance structure that in grays view prioritizes neoliberal orthodoxy over democratic accountability and the diverse economic preferences of its member populations• resistance to alternative economic models the eus commitment to a particular economic paradigm means that alternative models which might emphasize public welfare environmental sustainability or reduced income inequality face structural and ideological barriers countries that have sought to challenge or reform the neoliberal consensus within the eu either through proposed policy changes or through public referenda have often been met with resistance from eu institutions this gray argues reveals a fundamental inflexibility within the eu to accommodate diverse economic philosophies particularly those that challenge the primacy of the market• impact on social democracy gray sees the eus influence as being particularly detrimental to the prospects of social democracy within europe by embedding neoliberal policies at the supranational level the eu effectively narrows the policy space available for social democratic alternatives that seek to balance the markets efficiencies with social equity and public welfare this has implications not only for domestic politics within member states but also for the broader ideological landscape of europe where social democratic parties have historically played a significant rolejohn grays criticism of the eu centers on its role in cementing a neoliberal economic order that sidelines social democratic principles and limits the autonomy of member states to pursue alternative economic policies his critique reflects broader debates about the nature of european integration the balance between market freedoms and social protection and the democratic legitimacy of eu institutions predictions for american politicsjohn grays predictions for american politics involve a deepening legitimation crisis characterized by increasing political polarization a potential inward turn and a consequent reduction in the united states global influence and commitments this perspective is grounded in his broader critique of contemporary political systems and his skepticism towards the sustainability of current political and economic models heres grays outlook• deepening political polarization gray anticipates that political polarization in the united states will continue to intensify with the country increasingly divided along ideological cultural and economic lines this division is not just a matter of differing opinions but reflects a fundamental rift in how different segments of the population perceive reality the role of government and the direction the country should take such polarization challenges the very basis of consensus politics and undermines the possibility of effective governance• legitimation crisis at the heart of grays predictions is a legitimation crisis wherein a significant portion of the american populace no longer sees the federal government as legitimate or representative of their interests and values this crisis is exacerbated by controversies over election integrity the role of media and deepseated disagreements over issues such as immigration gun control and healthcare the result is a growing distrust in political institutions and leaders eroding the foundational trust necessary for a democratic society to function effectively• inward turn and isolationism in response to internal divisions and the challenges of maintaining its role as a global superpower gray foresees the united states taking a more isolationist stance this inward turn would manifest in a reluctance to engage in foreign conflicts a reevaluation of international commitments and a focus on domestic issues while not isolationist in the strictest sense this shift would represent a significant change from the postworld war ii era of active american leadership in global affairs• reduction in global influence a consequence of this inward turn would be a reduction in the united states global influence as the country becomes more preoccupied with its internal divisions and challenges its ability and willingness to project power and influence abroad may diminish this could lead to a reshaping of international alliances a vacuum of leadership in global governance and an opportunity for other powers such as china and russia to assert their influence more strongly• implications for democracy grays predictions also touch on the implications for democracy itself the legitimation crisis and polarization could lead to challenges in conducting fair and accepted elections governing effectively and addressing critical issues the erosion of democratic norms and institutions could result in a more authoritarian style of governance as leaders may seek to bypass traditional checks and balances in an effort to implement their agendas amidst deadlock and division• societal and economic consequences beyond politics gray suggests that the united states will face significant societal and economic consequences as a result of these trends economic inequality social unrest and a fraying social fabric could become more pronounced challenging the countrys ability to maintain cohesion and prosperityjohn grays vision of the future of american politics is one of increasing challenges to its democratic institutions societal cohesion and global standing his predictions reflect concerns about the sustainability of the current political and economic paradigms in the face of deepening divisions and a potential retreat from the global stage why the current system could be considered worse than feudalismjohn grays analysis suggests that the current system could be considered worse than feudalism in several respects based on his critique of contemporary political and economic structures• economic inequality and concentration of power modern neoliberal economies have led to unprecedented levels of economic inequality with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few this concentration is facilitated and exacerbated by global financial systems and corporate dominance unlike feudalism where obligations and protections were enforced between lords and vassals todays economic system often lacks mechanisms to ensure the welfare of those at the bottom of the economic hierarchy• loss of community and stability feudal societies despite their hierarchical nature provided a sense of place role and stability for most individuals within the system in contrast the modern globalized economy has eroded traditional communities and social bonds leaving individuals feeling alienated and disconnected the lack of social cohesion and community support networks contributes to a sense of isolation and insecurity that was less prevalent in feudal times• environmental degradation the relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption in the current system has led to environmental degradation on a scale unimaginable in feudal times gray might argue that the exploitation of natural resources without regard to ecological balance or sustainability is a fundamental flaw of the modern economic model posing existential risks that did not exist in the feudal era• technological displacement and uncertainty the rapid pace of technological change in the modern era has led to job displacement and a sense of uncertainty about the future while technological advancements have brought many benefits they also pose challenges to employment and social stability that feudal societies did not face the anxiety and insecurity generated by these changes can be seen as a negative aspect of the modern system• democratic deficits and governance modern democracies face significant challenges including political polarization the influence of money in politics and a perceived detachment of elected officials from the needs of their constituents these democratic deficits can lead to governance that is less responsive and accountable than the idealized vision of democracy potentially making modern systems less effective at addressing the needs of the populace than the more straightforward governance structures of feudal times• crisis of legitimation gray predicts a legitimation crisis in modern societies where increasing segments of the population no longer see the political and economic system as legitimate or representative of their interests this crisis is exacerbated by the aforementioned issues of inequality alienation and democratic deficits contributing to a sense of disillusionment and disenfranchisement that may be considered worse than the more stable if rigid social order of feudalismjohn grays critique suggests that the current system with its profound economic inequalities loss of community environmental degradation technological disruptions democratic deficits and a looming crisis of legitimation could be seen as offering a less stable and equitable form of social organization than feudalism despite the latters obvious limitations and inequities the us opioid epidemicjohn grays discussion about the us opioid epidemic is framed within his broader critique of contemporary societys failures and the consequences of neoliberal policies while he does not dedicate a specific section solely to discussing the opioid crisis his analysis of societal issues provides a context for understanding the epidemic as part of larger social and economic problems heres how grays perspectives relate to the opioid epidemic• symptom of social malaise gray might argue that the opioid epidemic is a symptom of deeper social and economic malaise including the disintegration of communities the erosion of stable jobs and the neglect of public health and welfare systems it reflects a society where many people feel disconnected disenfranchised and without hope for the future• failure of the neoliberal model the crisis can be seen as a consequence of the neoliberal economic model which prioritizes market freedom and individual responsibility over social welfare and community support this model has led to vast inequalities and a healthcare system that is often more focused on profit than on patient care contributing to the widespread availability and prescription of addictive painkillers• cultural and political neglect the opioid epidemic underscores a cultural and political neglect of the working class and rural populations who have been disproportionately affected by economic changes such as deindustrialization grays analysis would suggest that the epidemic is partly the result of political choices that have marginalized large segments of the population leaving them vulnerable to addiction as a form of escape from economic and social despair• critique of progress narratives grays skepticism towards narratives of inevitable progress and improvement is relevant here the opioid crisis challenges the idea that technological and economic advancements automatically lead to better lives for all instead it reveals how progress can have uneven and often devastating impacts on different communities• the role of big pharma while gray may not discuss this explicitly in the context of the opioid epidemic his critique of corporate influence and the commodification of life under neoliberal capitalism is relevant the aggressive marketing of opioids by pharmaceutical companies driven by profit motives with insufficient regard for public health exemplifies the ethical failures of a system that allows corporate interests to override societal wellbeing• response to the crisis in line with grays views on the limitations of current political and economic systems to address complex social issues the opioid epidemic represents a challenge that requires more than just marketbased solutions or individual interventions it calls for a comprehensive societal response including rethinking healthcare social support systems and the economic model that underpins american societyoverall while john gray does not specifically focus on the opioid epidemic his critiques of modern capitalism neoliberal policies and the neglect of social welfare provide a framework for understanding the crisis as part of broader societal failures \n",
            " newport rfd rhode islanddear hannahive read your book absorbed for the past two weeks in the bathtub riding in the car waiting in line in the grocery store it seems to me a truly extraordinary piece of work an advance in human thought of at the very least a decade and also engrossing and fascinating in the way that a novel is ie that it says something on nearly every page that is novel that one could not have anticipated from what went before but that one then recognizes as inevitable and foreshadowed by the underlying plot of ideas i liked particularly the south african section—the highest point to my mind of the writing—the section on disraeli on the elite and vice and crime on the modern nihilists on the structure of the totalitarian movement with the fellowtravelers representing reality to the members the members to the cadres and so on my remarks on the style at lunch which were largely secondhand i utterly withdraw there are a few barbarisms such as the use of ignore to mean be ignorant of that are of no consequence but might be corrected in another edition i would make one larger criticism the implication you make through the sheer exuberance of explaining its functioning that totalitarianism is a scheme in the minds of certain displaced men to rob other men of their sense of reality seems to me to scant the element of the fortuitous in the development of this whole phenomenon that is the fact that certain features have been incorporated into these movements without anyones cleverness simply because they worked in other words you sometimes suggest that are laws of political conduct comparable to the laws governing aesthetic matters that the nazis and stalin have special access to that they have understood and interpreted the meaning of their epoch as a great maître would have done ie that something existed prior to them of which they are the platonic shadows or eidolons this may very well be true it certainly is often the impression one gets and yet it is not demonstrably true here in the text for at other times you appear to take an opposite view that is that man is not interpreter or artiste to a rational universe but a creator without a model to draw fromi dont think i express this very well and i havent the book to consult having already lent it but perhaps you will see what i mean it is why the concluding remarks follow a little oddly on the text and why i think you lean perhaps a little too heavily on paradox a formalist truth in the opening chapters where factual evidence is slight or balky but all this is of very minor import and perhaps results from an amateurs innocence i mean mine not yours i thought david riesmans strictures and pious exceptions terribly stupid it seemed to me that he understood the book and the marvel of its construction very little how did the treatment of the natives by the boers influence hitler or words to that other great admirers of the book are the schlesingers who are very eager to meet you could you and heinrich come up to stay with us for the weekend after this one or any weekend in may they would like to come down and have lunch and talk to you whenever you can comebowden sends greetings to you both and many thanks to you as an author i must say as a fellow one i stand in awe among other things of your energy what a tremendous job that must have beenyoursmaryp s come on friday on the one oclock train departing at providence where well meet youp p s where would you situate d h lawrence much more to say on this point on the antisemitism of modern prophetic types lawrence pound dostoeivsky will save it for your visitnotes david riesmans strictures must have been delivered in conversation or in a panel discussion for there is no record of his having reviewed arendts book arthur schlesinger jr then teaching at harvard had recently published the vital center whose appearance had elicited a congratulatory note from mccarthy not unlike arendts overture to mccarthy after the oasissource between friends the correspondence of hannah arendt and mary mccarthy martin secker warburg ltd \n",
            " capitol hill three years oncoup in washington in the days following the election fears mounted that an unhinged trump might bomb iran the joint chiefs chairman alerted both his team and the chinese it wouldnt happenby luca ciarroccahow do we secure the nuclear missiles this question posed during a call between the highestranking military officer in america and the third in line for the presidential succession encapsulated the dramatic hours following the january assault on capitol hill – the failed coup by trump loyalistsit was general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the presidents principal military advisor who received the call from democratic house speaker nancy pelosi on january she was deeply alarmed by the chaos in washington with congress besieged by thousands of agitators stirred up by trumps incendiary speech milley sought to reassure her that despite the insurrection in terms of national security there were plenty of checks in the system most importantly in answer to her initial question the nuclear weapons are securethis was critical because the president – with his infamous nuclear football – has the final say on deploying nuclear arms and trump during those days seemed derangedin the final weeks of milley became convinced that trump psychologically destabilized by his november electoral defeat posed an imminent and real danger the populist tycoon had lost by a wide margin million fewer votes than biden yet continued to insist the elections were rigged stolen trump according to the general had undergone mental decline following the vote becoming almost maniacal screaming at senior advisors and staff members desperately clinging to power denying reality and spreading lies milley would later explainwhen the defeated president incited thousands of his fans to march on capitol hill on january resulting in violence damage five deaths and the arrest of people the joint chiefs chairman realized he couldnt just stand by after his call with pelosi he summoned a secret meeting in his pentagon office with the top brass of the armed forces – the participants of the national military command center the defense ministrys war room the goal to review the military engagement procedures with enemies including the launch of nuclear missiles he reiterated that only the president could give the order but – heres the startling new development – he milley had to be consulted for the final okaythe chairman appointed by trump himself instructed the pentagons top echelons to not take orders from anyone – not even the president holed up in the oval office – unless he was involved no matter what youre told you follow the procedure follow the procedure and im part of that procedure he ordered his subordinates and stay alert at all times milley now retired then made two more calls the first to national security agency director paul nakasone keep your antennas up keep watching scan every signal and the second to cia director gina haspel monitor everything very aggressively degrees the cia chief confirmed the escalating tension scenario were heading towards a rightwing coup the whole affair is madness hes behaving like a sixyearold throwing a tantrum haspel feared trump might try to attack iran to prove to the world he still held full powers and an aggressive international strategythe urgency of the available precautions to prevent the defeated president from launching nuclear missiles was confirmed in a letter pelosi sent to the democratic caucus this morning i spoke on the phone with the joint chiefs of staff chairman general mark milley to discuss the available precautions to prevent an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike the letter read it arrived as democrats were doing everything to remove trump from office pursuing two parallel paths via an intervention by vice president mike pence and some cabinet members two resigned betsy devos and elaine chao and with a congressional impeachment request which happened but trump was narrowly saved thanks to some gop congress membersthe tumultuous hours of the pelosimilley call were scrutinized by journalists bob woodward and robert costa of the washington post the former the author of the watergate scoop that led to richard nixons resignation in august the latter a political analyst for nbc news and msnbc in their book peril woodward and costa revealed further details on the geopolitical front milley its reported in peril called his chinese counterpart at least twice just before the november elections and shortly after the failed coup the wellestablished direct relationship the us supreme commander had woven with li zuocheng general of the peoples liberation army of china and chief of the joint staff department of the central military commission in beijing was providential with washington engulfed in instability it was vital to avoid armed conflict between the two superpowers every good faith precaution was needed to ensure there was no historic breakdown of the international order no accidental war with china or other countries and no use of nuclear weapons milley later explained to the senate defense committee to make himself understood the american told the chinese we have a plane with four engines and three are out we dont have a landing gear but were going to land this plane safelyit sounds like geopolitical fantasy but milley believed that china already alert due to trumps psychotic behavior might militarily attack the united states if xi jinping felt threatened by an unpredictable unstable and vindictive white house an extraordinary risk so something unprecedented happened the military leaders of the two rival superpowers found themselves united by a common mission to prevent the outbreak of world war iiithe first call took place on october four days before the presidential election and the second on january two days after the assault on capitol hill milley had reviewed a topsecret report from the pentagons intelligence services which also weighed tensions over taiwan with us navy exercises in the south china sea exacerbated by trumps warmongering antichina rhetoric the sharp confrontation between the superpowers was intensified by the neomccarthyism against anything chinese from beijings hightech companies listed on wall street to popular apps like tiktok not to mention labeled as the chinese virus general li i want to reassure you our government is stable and everything will be fine milley explained to his counterpart were one hundred percent stable everythings fine democracy can sometimes be messy but we have no intention of conducting any military operations against you milley even assured he would preemptively warn li zuocheng in the event of a missile launch you and i have known each other for five years now if were forced to ill call you in advance it wont be a surprisetoday the situation is in many ways worse as the story of january confirms preestablished protocols are crucial but the rationality of leaders is of fundamental importance nonetheless were all

origin oscars upbringing and education his rise in london society and his contributions to literature from poetry and essays to renowned plays like the importance of being earnest holland also touches on the darker aspects of wildes life including his trial imprisonment and posthumous conversion to catholicism ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history introduction to the editionby vyvyan hollandoscar wildes family is dutch in origin the first wilde to settle in ireland was a certain colonel de wilde the son of an artist examples of whose work hang in the art gallery at the hague he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to king william iii of england he is said to have repented his adherence to the english king and to have become more irish than the irish from that time the family were land agents and doctorsmy fathers parents were both distinguished in their own way sir william wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time and a physician of international repute he invented the operation for cataract and performed it on king oscar of sweden for which he received the order of the polar star his mother lady wilde born jane francesca elgee was a staunch irish nationalist who wrote fierce poems and articles in the irish nationalist newspaper the nation under the name of speranza a name she had adopted from her motto fidanza constanza speranza – faith constancy hope lady wilde had three children william oscar and isola who died when she was ten to oscars lasting grief oscar wilde was born on october and was given the names oscar fingal oflahertie wills wildehis education began at portora royal school in enniskillen from which he obtained a scholarship to trinity college dublin where he won the berkeley gold medal for greek from there he received a demyship to magdalen college oxford while at oxford he came under the influence of john ruskin and walter pater pater preached the love of art for arts sake and oscar wilde going one step further set out to idolise beauty for beautys sake and filled his rooms looking over the cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by rossetti and burnejones aestheticism was the keynote of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strivemy fathers life at oxford one gathers from his letters was a joyous one he entered wholeheartedly into the undergraduate life of the university and distinguished himself by winning the newdigate prize for english verse and getting a double first in classics upon this note he came to london in with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen true to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the apostle of aestheticism and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress it must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the british upper middle classes was rigidly conventional and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid kneebreeches black silk stockings a soft loose shirt with a wide turndown collar and a large flowing tie was bound to arouse indignant curiosityat the same time he was writing poems and in he also wrote vera a rather immature play which ran for one week in new york in and never reached the boards in london in his collected poems were published and in being short of money he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to america this proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to england in covered if not with glory at least with considerable notorietyon his return to europe he retired to paris to finish another play the duchess of padua for the american actress mary anderson but when she received the play she turned it down flatly this was really a disaster for oscar wilde and he returned to england and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces however this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to london where in he married constance mary daughter of a distinguished irish barrister horace lloyd qc oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy he had two sons by his wife – cyril born in and myself in oddly enough although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage he now turned largely to prose and with the exception of the sphinx the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment when he wrote the ballad of reading gaol boris brasol who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father sums up his poetic period as followshe began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which however as he himself admitted there was more rhyme than reason yet as he grew older he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry and though there is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which browning aptly called the unlocking of hearts with sonnet keysupon what then does his reputation as an author rest his early poems were mostly lyrical and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time his true literary life was spread over seven years only from until in he had become editor of womans world in which capacity he continued until when he resigned he had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and still more as a conversationalist there are few people alive now who remember his conversation but when in a plaque was unveiled by sir compton mackenzie on the house in tite street where my family lived for eleven years he read the following message from sir max beerbohm the incomparable max who felt too frail to undertake the journey to london to be presenti have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk – meredith and swinburne edmund gosse and henry james augustine birrell and arthur balfour gilbert chesterton and desmond maccarthy and hilaire belloc – all of them splendid in their own way but oscar was the greatest of them all – the most spontaneous and yet the most polished the most soothing and yet the most surprisingnobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso to have heard him consoled me for not having heard dr johnson or edmund burke lord brougham or sidney smithwinston churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life and he replied without hesitation oscar wildewildes first memorable work was the happy prince which appeared in the stories in the happy prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adultsin he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously the book was called lord arthur saviles crime and other stories the other three tales being the canterville ghost the sphinx without a secret and the model millionaire the first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions they possess the lighthearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in the importance of being earnest and show the buoyancy of my fathers spirit at that timea house of pomegranates my fathers other book of short stories – one can hardly call them fairy tales – appeared with illustrations by charles shannon ra in the same year this book completely puzzled the critics who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested quite rightly that no child could understand them this was followed by the sphinx which really dated from his oxford days and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since the critics were again confused by the poem which was really nothing more than an experiment with words he revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque which he rhymed with hippogriff and amenalkin too oscar wildes only novel the picture of dorian gray appeared in book form enlarged from the original which had been already published in lippincotts magazine the publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics the english press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book the idea of the book had first come to my father some years before hesketh pearson tells the story of it in his life of oscar wilde in the year wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter basil ward one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beautywhen the portrait was done and the youth had gone wilde happened to say what a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old the artist agreed adding how delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is while the portrait aged and withered in his stead wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story basil hallwardby far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that oscar wilde wrote was intentions in which he really gave rein to his imagination in my own opinion it is the most absorbing of all his works the critic as artist occupies considerably more than half of it its subtitle with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing shows the curious charm the word importance had for him it occurs in the titles of two of his plays and is constantly cropping up in his essays it is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it if not round his tongue then round his mindbut the most interesting essay in the book is the decay of lying the essay is in the form of a dialogue the dominant theme being the vast superiority of art over nature leading to the conclusion that nature follows artoscar wilde now entered into his final stage the one for which he was destined that of a dramatist in he wrote lady windermeres fan which he described as one of those modern drawingroom plays with pink lampshades it was produced at the st jamess theatre in february by george alexander there were loud cries of author at the end of the play and wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said ladies and gentlemen i have enjoyed this evening immensely the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play and your appreciation has been most intelligent i congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as i dowhen wilde had finished lady windermeres fan he retired to paris and wrote his biblical play salome in french dedicated to pierre louys who made certain corrections in the french but did not otherwise interfere with it sarah bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play and she put it into rehearsal at the palace theatre in london with herself in the titlerole however the lord chamberlain refused to grant it a licence on the ground that no play which contained biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the english stage this so annoyed wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his british nationality and becoming a frenchman there being no such restrictions in france as matters turned out it is a pity that he did not carry out his threatin the summer of he wrote a woman of no importance which was produced with immediate success by herbert beerbohm tree at the haymarket in once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author this time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of lady windermeres fan he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced ladies and gentlemen i regret to inform you that mr oscar wilde is not in the houseon january oscar wildes third important play an ideal husband was produced by lewis waller the prince of wales was present at the first night it was almost unprecedented for royalty to be present at a first night and it seemed now that wildes future was assured george bernard shaws comment on the play is worth repeating mr oscar wildes new play at the haymarket is a dangerous subject because he has the property of making his critics dullhe plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with the whole theatreand so we come to oscar wildes last and his most brilliant play the importance of being earnest wilde originally wrote the play in four acts as he had written his other three major plays he submitted it in this form to george alexander who with the object of making room for a curtain raiser as was usual in those days asked wilde to cut it to three acts when four years later leonard smithers published the play in book form it was this threeact version that he had printed and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern why this has been so is not clear but the play as written by oscar wilde with two extra characters in it is the play as given in this volume as mr philip drake who is responsible for this edition of wildes works remarked it seems a pity that george alexander should have a permanent influence on the playthe importance of being earnestwas produced at the st jamess theatre on february wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the west end and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them then the marquess of queensberry with the object of attacking his son lord alfred douglas because of his friendship with wilde launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on wilde the story has been told often enough alfred douglas whose only object was to see his father in the dock persuaded oscar wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him lord queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by oscar wilde who was sentenced to two years imprisonmentwhile in prison wilde wrote the letter to lord alfred douglas part of which was published in by robert ross under the title of de profundis in a letter to robert ross he wrote this is indeed an encyclical letter and as the bulls of the holy father are named from their opening words it may be spoken of as epistola in carcere el vinculis the manuscript was not revised by wilde although he intended to do this as is shown by the letter he wrote to robert ross as soon as you have read it i want you to have it copied for me as regards the method of copying i wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections a copy of de profundis was made and sent to alfred douglas but after reading the first few pages he destroyed it probably thinking rather naively that there was no other copy in existence douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter and he could not go back on this without contradicting himselfafter my fathers death in alfred douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript but robert ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the british museum with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years that is to say until at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be deadthe copying was done hastily and without much care because the version printed in varied in several particulars from the original manuscript although of course the substance was the same the version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as wilde wrote itthe portrait of mr w h was first published as an article of words in blackwoods magazine for july oscar wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he rewrote the story and added to it bringing the total up to words the manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my fathers effects at tite street together with others and did not reappear until the year in america where it was published in a limited edition by mitchell kennerley the expanded version is printed in this editionthe only work that my father wrote after was the poem the ballad of reading gaol which he wrote at berneval so that douglass claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored as he and wilde did not meet again until laterall his life my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the catholic church into which he was received on his death bed in his remains now lie in the french national cemetery of pere

            " in his book technofeudalism what killed capitalism yanis varoufakis explores how giant tech firms both in the us and china are expanding their control over the planet his analysis is that whilst material resources certainly matter the real battle ground is over digital real estatevaroufakis a renowned economist and political thinker presents a future where the digital age has not ushered in the equitable socialist utopia many had hoped for but has instead birthed a new form of inequality and economic disparity reminiscent of feudal times yet distinctly marked by digital characteristicsthe foundation of varoufakiss argument rests on the observation that the digital giants—companies like google uber facebook apple and amazon—have amassed unprecedented power and wealth not merely through traditional capitalist means but by establishing monopolies over digital platforms and resources these companies according to varoufakis are the new lords of a technofeudal system where the cloud serves as their domain from which they extract rent much like feudal lords extracted rent from landthis technofeudalism is characterized by the concentration of capital and power in the hands of a few a phenomenon that while not entirely new has reached new heights in the digital age the traditional capitalist notion of competition and market dynamics has given way to a system where access to digital platforms is controlled by these giants effectively stifling competition and innovation from smaller entities europes lag in developing its own digital giants exacerbates this issue making it dependent on american and chinese tech monopoliesvaroufakis further argues that this concentration of power and capital has significant implications for taxation and the distribution of wealth amazons operations in europe where it generates billions in revenue while paying minimal taxes exemplify the skewed financial benefits that favor these digital overlords this he posits is not merely a failure of capitalism but a transformation into something more sinister that mirrors feudalism where societal wealth is siphoned to the top leaving the masses with fewer economic opportunities and benefitsthe shift to technofeudalism as varoufakis describes is also marked by a mutation within capitalism itself capitalism in its quest for growth and dominance has birthed a form of capital—cloud capital—that has ultimately turned on its creator this cloud capital controlled by the tech giants has the power to extract rents and surpluses from both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie redefining the economic landscape and power dynamicsvaroufakiss insights into the role of digital currencies and payment systems further highlight the transformation underway the development of digital currencies by china contrasted with europes lack of similar innovation underscores the shifting balance of economic power and the emergence of new centers of economic control and influencein discussing the geopolitical implications of this shift varoufakis points to the rising tensions between the united states and china the competition is not merely economic but also technological with both nations vying for dominance in the digital realm this rivalry he fears could lead to conflict emphasizing the importance of understanding technofeudalism not just as an economic phenomenon but as a factor reshaping global politics and power structuresfurthermore varoufakis critiques the liberal notion of the individual arguing that the pervasive influence of big tech on our lives has eroded the autonomy and privacy that are central to liberal democracy the data collected by these tech giants on individuals preferences behaviors and interactions not only fuels their economic dominance but also challenges the very notion of individual freedom and autonomyin conclusion varoufakiss discussion of technofeudalism presents a compelling and concerning vision of the future where the digital revolution has not liberated humanity but has instead entrenched new forms of inequality and control the rise of digital giants as the new feudal lords of the century wielding power over digital realms and extracting economic rents from society signals a profound shift in the economic and social order this transition challenges us to rethink our understanding of capitalism democracy and freedom in the digital age urging a reevaluation of the systems and structures that govern our lives how big tech has enslaved us according to yanis varoufakisyanis varoufakis articulates a compelling argument on how big tech has in essence enslaved contemporary society drawing on the concept of technofeudalism to describe this phenomenon according to varoufakis the evolution of capitalism into this new phase is characterized by several key dynamics monopolization of the digital space big tech companies like amazon google facebook now meta and apple have established dominant positions in the digital economy effectively monopolizing vast swathes of the internet this dominance allows them to control access to markets information and communication platforms exerting unprecedented power over both consumers and producers extraction of digital rents varoufakis argues that these tech giants extract enormous rents from the economy without the traditional exchange of goods and services by controlling the digital infrastructure — the cloud — these companies can impose fees and conditions that extract wealth from both individuals and businesses funneling profits to an elite few while contributing minimally to public coffers through tax avoidance strategies surveillance and data exploitation the enslavement also extends to the pervasive surveillance and data mining practices of big tech companies by harvesting vast amounts of personal data these entities not only invade privacy but also manipulate consumer behavior and preferences locking individuals into a cycle of consumption and influence that diminishes autonomy and personal freedom erosion of liberal individualism varoufakis highlights how the technofeudal system undermines the concept of the liberal individual — a cornerstone of democratic society the constant monitoring and data collection by big tech companies compromise the autonomy and selfdetermination of individuals reshaping identities and behaviors through algorithmic manipulation perpetuation of inequality the technofeudal model exacerbates inequality by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the tech oligarchs while the majority of society sees diminishing economic prospects and eroding rights this concentration of power mirrors feudal structures where lords wielded control over land and serfs but in the modern context its digital territory and data dependency and powerlessness societys increasing dependency on digital platforms for economic social and political engagement has rendered individuals and smaller entities powerless against the might of big tech this dependency is likened to feudal vassalage where serfs had no choice but to submit to the lords authority geopolitical implications varoufakis also delves into the geopolitical ramifications of big techs rise particularly the tension between the us and china as both nations vie for technological and economic supremacy this rivalry underscores the global impact of technofeudalism with europe lagging behind and losing relevance in the new digital orderin summary yanis varoufakis paints a stark picture of a society ensnared by the technological and economic might of big tech companies this enslavement according to his analysis is not just a matter of economic dominance but extends to the very fabric of individual freedom societal structure and global power dynamics signaling a profound shift from traditional capitalist models to a new era of technofeudalism jeff bezos and amazonyanis varoufakis discusses jeff bezos within the broader narrative of technofeudalism highlighting how bezos through amazon exemplifies the shift from traditional capitalist practices to a new era where digital platforms and cloud capital dominate bezos is portrayed as a modern feudal lord of the digital age where his control over amazons vast online marketplace and cloud services positions him at the forefront of this economic transformationvaroufakis points out that amazon under bezoss leadership has become more than just an online retailer it is a massive platform that controls significant portions of the digital economy from ecommerce to cloud computing services this control allows amazon to extract rents from other businesses that rely on its platform to reach consumers a practice reminiscent of feudal lords extracting rent from their lands the comparison to feudalism is used to illustrate the power dynamics in the digital economy where platform owners like bezos wield immense power over the market shaping economic activities and influencing the distribution of wealthfurthermore varoufakis criticizes the tax practices associated with companies like amazon he highlights how amazon generates billions in revenue particularly in europe without contributing a proportionate amount in taxes this situation exacerbates economic inequalities and underscores the challenges that digital economies pose to traditional frameworks of taxation and regulationthe discussion around bezos and amazon serves to underline the broader themes of technofeudalism that varoufakis explores it reflects concerns about the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few digital platform owners the erosion of traditional market dynamics and the societal implications of these shifts including impacts on privacy labor and democracy through the example of bezos varoufakis calls attention to the urgent need to address these challenges and rethink the governance of digital economies to ensure a more equitable and democratic future elon muskyanis varoufakis discusses elon musk within the context of the broader shift towards technofeudalism highlighting musks ambitions and the strategic moves he has made in the tech world as emblematic of the new forms of power and control emerging in the digital age musk known for his ventures such as tesla and his interest in acquiring twitter serves as a case study for varoufakiss arguments about cloud capital and its impact on societyvaroufakis points out that elon musks ventures particularly tesla are not just about manufacturing electric vehicles but are deeply integrated with digital technologies and cloud capital tesla cars connected to the cloud collect vast amounts of data on their users behaviors preferences and movements this data collection extends beyond the automotive industry touching on aspects of digital surveillance and data monetization that are central to technofeudalism musks desire to replicate a platform like wechat which combines social media messaging payments and other services into a single ecosystem is highlighted as an attempt to further integrate and control various aspects of digital and physical lifethe discussion around musk and his interest in platforms like twitter underscores a broader trend where tech entrepreneurs are not just content creators or service providers but are becoming the new lords of the digital realm they wield significant power over the digital landscapes they control much like feudal lords once controlled their lands and the people within them this comparison is used to illustrate the transformation of capital in the digital age where ownership of digital platforms and the data they generate becomes a source of unprecedented power and wealthvaroufakiss insights into musks activities reflect concerns over the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants and entrepreneurs this concentration is seen as a fundamental feature of technofeudalism where digital platforms become new fiefs and their owners the new feudal lords exert significant influence over the economy society and even the political landscape musks ventures exemplify how technology and capital are merging to create new forms of economic and social organization challenging traditional notions of capitalism and prompting a reevaluation of our future in a digitally dominated world teslayanis varoufakis discusses tesla within the context of the transition from traditional capitalism to what he terms technofeudalism emphasizing the role of companies like tesla in this new economic landscape tesla led by elon musk is not just an automaker but a tech company that exemplifies the fusion of technology with traditional manufacturing reshaping economic relationships and production methods heres how varoufakis frames tesla in his analysistesla as a cloud companyvaroufakis highlights that teslas value and innovation extend beyond the manufacturing of electric vehicles tesla is deeply integrated into the cloud leveraging data collection connectivity and software to enhance its vehicles and customer experience this integration allows tesla to continuously update and improve its vehicles after purchase a stark contrast to traditional automakers whose products remain static postsaledata and value extractionteslas vehicles are equipped with a range of sensors and connectivity features that collect vast amounts of data on driving habits preferences and vehicle performance this data is not just used to refine teslas products but also represents a form of cloud capital according to varoufakis this positions tesla similarly to big tech firms that extract value through data distinguishing it from conventional car manufacturers teslas business model therefore embodies the technofeudalism thesis where value is increasingly derived from digital and datadriven domains rather than solely physical goodsthe cloud as capitalvaroufakis uses tesla as an example to illustrate his broader point that the cloud has become a form of capital in itself in this new economy companies like tesla that can harness cloudbased data and platforms possess a significant competitive advantage they are not just selling products but are also engaging in the extraction of datadriven value a characteristic feature of technofeudalismimpact on traditional industryteslas rise and its approach to vehicle production and data utilization signify a shift in how value is created and captured in the economy this shift challenges traditional industrial companies which are more reliant on physical production and less integrated with digital technologies varoufakis suggests that companies unable to adapt to this cloudbased model may find themselves at a disadvantage further accelerating the divide between traditional capitalism and the emerging technofeudal systemtesla and the future of workthe discussion around tesla also touches on broader implications for the future of work and the economy as companies leverage cloud capital and data the nature of work value creation and economic power structures are transformed this raises questions about labor rights data privacy and the distribution of economic benefits in a world where a few tech giants could dominate much of the economic landscapevaroufakiss mention of tesla serves to exemplify the broader economic transformation towards technofeudalism where the integration of technology data and cloud platforms redefines value creation and economic power tesla in this analysis is not merely an automotive company but a symbol of the shift towards a new economic order dominated by digital technologies and datadriven business models free payments wechat pay and alipayin the discussion yanis varoufakis touches upon the concept of free payments in the context of digital platforms and technologies particularly referencing chinas advancements in this area this concept is part of his broader analysis of technofeudalism and how certain technological innovations are reshaping economic and social relationsthe concept of free paymentsfree payments refer to the ability to conduct financial transactions without incurring traditional banking fees facilitated by digital platforms that bypass conventional financial institutions this innovation is significant in the context of big techs encroachment into the financial sector offering a glimpse into how these companies are leveraging technology to create alternative financial ecosystems that challenge the status quocase study chinas digital currency and payment systemsvaroufakis highlights chinas development of digital currency and payment platforms such as wechat pay and alipay as prime examples of the free payments phenomenon these platforms allow users to make transactions directly from their smartphones seamlessly integrating payment capabilities into a broader digital ecosystem that includes social media ecommerce and more the critical innovation here is the elimination of transaction fees typically charged by banks thereby democratizing access to digital financial services and enhancing the efficiency of economic transactionsimplications of free payments disruption of traditional banking the rise of free payment platforms challenges the business model of traditional banks which rely on transaction fees as a significant revenue source this shift could lead to a reconfiguration of the banking industry pushing it toward more innovative and userfriendly services centralization of power while free payments democratize access to financial services they also concentrate power in the hands of platform operators like big tech firms who control the digital infrastructure facilitating these transactions this centralization raises concerns about privacy data security and the potential for abuse of market dominance economic and social transformation the widespread adoption of free payment technologies can transform economies particularly in developing countries where traditional banking services are limited by enabling more efficient and inclusive financial transactions these technologies can spur economic growth and social development regulatory challenges the emergence of free payment systems poses significant regulatory challenges as governments and financial authorities grapple with issues of privacy cybersecurity financial stability and competition the global nature of big tech companies further complicates regulatory efforts requiring international cooperation to address these challenges effectively strategic geopolitical considerations varoufakis also points out the geopolitical dimensions of free payment systems particularly in the context of uschina rivalry the development of digital currencies and payment platforms is part of a broader contest for technological supremacy with implications for global economic leadership and strategic influenceyanis varoufakiss discussion of free payments within the framework of technofeudalism underscores the transformative potential of digital financial technologies while these innovations offer opportunities for economic empowerment and efficiency they also raise critical questions about privacy power concentration and the future of financial systems in a digitally dominated world the evolution of free payment systems exemplifies the broader shifts in economic and social relations that varoufakis associates with the transition to a new era of technofeudalism bill clintonyanis varoufakis mentions bill clinton in the context of discussing the evolution of capitalism and the regulatory changes that occurred during clintons presidency which had significant implications for the financial sector and broader economic landscape clintons tenure in the is notable for several policies that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the deregulation of financial markets aspects that varoufakis critiques in his analysis of the shift towards technofeudalismkey points related to clintons policies deregulation of the financial sector one of the hallmark policies of the clinton administration was the deregulation of the financial industry this included the repeal of the glasssteagall act through the grammleachbliley act of which removed the separation between commercial banking investment banking and insurance services this deregulation is often cited as a factor that contributed to the financialization of the economy and the increased risktaking behavior of financial institutions leading up to the financial crisis of promotion of financialization the clinton administrations policies are seen as facilitating the financialization of the american economy a process by which financial services became a more dominant sector influencing economic policy and corporate strategies this shift towards financialization is characterized by an increased role of financial markets institutions and motives in the economy contributing to the phenomena that varoufakis identifies as part of the movement towards technofeudalism global economic policies clintons tenure also saw the promotion of globalization and free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta while intended to boost economic growth through increased trade these policies also had wideranging effects on labor markets and the distribution of economic power themes that are central to varoufakiss critique of the current economic order impact on inequality varoufakis and other critics argue that the economic policies of the clinton era particularly those related to deregulation and financialization have contributed to rising inequality they assert that these policies benefited financial elites and the tech oligarchs at the expense of the broader population exacerbating economic disparitiesin mentioning clinton varoufakis underscores the significance of political and regulatory decisions in shaping the economic landscape leading to the conditions that he describes as technofeudalism clintons presidency is cited as a pivotal period when policies that favored deregulation and financialization were implemented setting the stage for the economic challenges and transformations that varoufakis explores in his work surveillance and privacyyanis varoufakis paints a concerning picture of how digital platforms and cloud capital have fundamentally altered the nature of individual autonomy and privacy he argues that the rise of big tech companies and their control over digital infrastructure have led to an unprecedented level of surveillance far surpassing anything imagined in traditional or even dystopian views of state surveillancehe highlights how these companies collect vast amounts of data on individuals behaviors preferences and interactions this data collection is not incidental but central to the business models of these platforms which rely on harvesting personal information to generate profits through targeted advertising selling data to third parties or refining their services to increase user engagement and dependencethe economist critically examines the relationship between individuals and digital platforms especially how platforms like amazons alexa or googles search engine are designed to learn from users only to use that information to influence and modify their behavior in return this cycle of data collection and behavioral influence challenges the liberal notion of the autonomous individual suggesting that our choices and preferences are increasingly shaped by algorithms and corporate interests rather than genuine personal freedomvaroufakiss analysis extends to the societal implications of this surveillance economy questioning the viability of privacy in a world where personal data is the primary currency he suggests that the very concept of the liberal individual—a cornerstone of democratic societies—is under threat in an era where peoples thoughts movements and desires are constantly monitored and commodified by tech giantsmoreover he touches on the psychological impact of living under constant surveillance where individuals must curate their online presence with the awareness that future employers governments or malicious actors might scrutinize their digital footprints this reality erodes the distinction between public and private life forcing individuals to selfcensor or alter their behavior not just in digital spaces but in all aspects of life due to the omnipresence of digital surveillancein essence varoufakis warns that technofeudalism with its foundation in cloud capital and digital platforms has ushered in an era where surveillance and the erosion of privacy are not just byproducts but essential mechanisms of power and control this shift has profound implications for democracy freedom and human dignity challenging us to reconsider the values and structures that underpin our societies in the digital age europeyanis varoufakis expresses a stark and sobering view on europes position in the emerging global order dominated by technofeudalism he believes that europe has become increasingly irrelevant on the world stage particularly in the face of rising powers like china and the united states which have developed significant technological and economic dominance through their control of cloud capital and digital platforms europes lack of comparable digital giants leaves it at a significant disadvantage making it dependent on american and chinese tech monopolies for digital infrastructure and servicesvaroufakis points out that europe does not have its own equivalents to google facebook uber apple or amazon this absence means that european companies and economies are forced to operate within the digital and economic ecosystems controlled by these foreign giants effectively rendering europe a vassal to their technofeudal empires this dependency is not just an economic concern but also a geopolitical weakness as europe lacks the technological sovereignty to assert itself in the digital agethe conversation highlights the significant tax contributions—or the lack thereof—made by tech giants in europe amazons operations serve as a prime example with the company making billions in revenue within europe while paying minimal taxes this situation underscores the economic disparities that technofeudalism exacerbates with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few noneuropean entities while european states and citizens are left with diminishing returns and influencefurthermore varoufakis discusses the geopolitical implications of europes diminished role particularly in the context of rising tensions between the united states and china he suggests that europes political and economic fragmentation combined with its technological lag renders it a secondary player in global affairs the continents inability to present a unified or powerful front in international negotiations or conflicts such as the situation in ukraine exemplifies its declining influencevaroufakiss perspective on europe is not just an economic critique but also a call to recognize the profound transformations underway in the global order he argues that europes future is at risk unless it can navigate the challenges of technofeudalism reclaim technological sovereignty and redefine its role in a world where digital platforms and cloud capital are reshaping economies societies and geopolitics \n"

        "Below is a concise explanation of the functioning of CountVectorizer:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Tokenization involves the process of breaking down the input text documents into individual words or tokens. This process entails decomposing each document into discrete words or concepts, also known as tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Vocabulary Construction: The system proceeds to create a lexicon consisting of all distinct tokens found in the input documents. Every individual token is transformed into a distinct feature within the vocabulary, and each document is represented as a row inside the resulting matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)Counting: The process involves tallying the frequency of each token in the vocabulary for every document and populating the matrix with the respective values.

        "The term \"ngram_range\" refers to a range of consecutive words or characters that are considered as a unit in natural language processing tasks. This option defines the scope of n-grams to be taken into account during the process of tokenizing the text. An n-gram refers to a consecutive series of n elements extracted from a specific text sample. In the case of the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\", the 1-grams (unigrams) consist of individual words: [\"The\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"]. The 2-grams (bigrams) are pairs of consecutive words: [\"The cat\", \"cat sat\", \"sat on\", \"on the\", \"the mat\"]. Lastly, the 3-grams (trigrams) are groups of three consecutive words: [\"The cat sat\", \"cat sat on\", \"sat on the\", \"on the mat\"]. The ngram_range parameter is defined as a tuple (min_n, max_n), where min_n represents the smallest number of tokens in an n-gram and max_n represents the maximum number of tokens in an n-gram. The default value for ngram_range is (1, 1), meaning that only unigrams are considered."

        "min_df refers to the minimum frequency of a term in a document that is required for it to be included in the analysis. This parameter defines the minimum threshold for the number of documents in which a token must be included in order to be considered part of the vocabulary. For instance, when min_df=2, it indicates that a token must be included in a minimum of 2 documents in order to be evaluated. If the value of min_df is a float, it indicates the minimum proportion of documents in which the token must appear. For example, when min_df=0.1, it indicates that the token must be present in a minimum of 10% of the documents. The default value for min_df is 1, indicating that the token must be present in at least one document."

For instance, when max_df=0.5, it indicates that a token can exist in a maximum of 50% of the documents in order to be considered. If max_df is specified as a float, it denotes the fraction of documents in which the token is allowed to occur. For example, when max_df=0.9, it indicates that the token is allowed to appear in a maximum of 90% of the documents. The default value for max_df is 1.0, indicating that there is no upper limit."
